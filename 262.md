# Incorrect reserveAmount when users redeem LeverageToken from Pool

### Summary

Coding mistake - Using `marketRate` of BondToken when users redeem LeverageToken will cause incorrect calculation of `reserveAmount` and possibly result in users' loss of reserve tokens.

### Root Cause

In Pool, each user should redeem the correct amount of reserve token with the price calculated as specified by the formulae in the documentation. However, the `simulateRedeem()` and `getRedeemAmount()` functions do not work correctly as the formulae specified. This is because the final `redeemRate` value is always (for both BondToken and LeverageToken type) the lesser value between `redeemRate` value calculated with the formulae and `marketRate` value, which is BondToken's price from the bond oracle (if existed). This would lead to the redemption of LeverageToken with the current price of BondToken. 

In [Pool.sol:446](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L446), the `marketRate` is assigned with the price of BondToken fetched from bond oracle and later passed into the `getRedeemAmount()` function.

```solidity
function simulateRedeem(TokenType tokenType, uint256 depositAmount) public view returns(uint256) {
    ...
    uint256 marketRate;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(address(bondToken), USD);
    if (feed != address(0)) {
      marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD)...
    }

    return getRedeemAmount(...,marketRate,...)
    ...
  }
```

In [Pool.sol:519-521](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L519-L521), the final value of `redeemRate` is calculated as the lesser value between `redeemRate` (from the formulae) and `marketRate` (BondToken price), which will cause the unwanted usage of BondToken price when users are claiming LeverageToken and BondToken's market price is lower than LeverageToken price calculated from the formulae.
```solidity
function getRedeemAmount(
    TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 bondSupply,
    uint256 levSupply,
    uint256 poolReserves,
    uint256 ethPrice,
    uint8 oracleDecimals,
    uint256 marketRate
  ) public pure returns(uint256) {
    ...

    if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
      redeemRate = marketRate;
    }
    
    // Calculate and return the final redeem amount
    return ((depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) / ethPrice) / PRECISION;
  }
```

### Impact

As the capped price of BondToken is 100 USD, users could lose a huge proportion of their reserve token when redeeming LeverageToken at a high price, e.g. 87.5% if the price of LeverageToken is 800 USD (average price from the testnet UI). While there's a parameter for `minAmount` to receive when calling `redeem()`, this incorrect value is returned by the `simulateRedeem()` function, which is assumed to be used by most users to calculate the expected return amount. Therefore, the loss of users' assets is highly expected to occur in this scenario.
