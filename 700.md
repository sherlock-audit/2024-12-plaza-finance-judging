# joinBalancerPool()

 Unhandled Excess Assets (Difference Between maxAmountsIn and Actual Usage) Leading to “Stuck” Tokens in the Contract

In Balancer V2’s joinPool call, there are two key mechanisms for specifying input amounts:
	•	maxAmountsIn: Specifies the maximum amount of tokens that can be used.
	•	userData: Typically contains details about the join type and the exact shares the user wants to add.

Now, what happens if the actual required amount for the pool is less than the amount specified in maxAmountsIn?
	•	Since the function calls joinPool with address(this) as both the from and recipient, and fromInternalBalance = false, the Balancer Vault returns any unused portion of the tokens to the contract (address(this)) rather than automatically refunding them to the user (msg.sender).
	•	However, the code does not include any logic to transfer these excess tokens back to the user. This means that if a user provides a higher max amount than what is actually needed, the unused tokens remain stuck in the router contract, creating a withdrawal risk.

Potential Consequences

If the caller intends to use an exact amount, they must ensure that maxAmountsIn precisely matches the intended deposit specified in userData. Otherwise, any unused portion will remain locked in the router contract, and the user will be unable to retrieve it directly.

Many projects implementing router logic handle this issue by either:
	1.	Only allowing exact amounts: Enforcing that maxAmountsIn matches the user’s intended deposit amount, eliminating any leftover balances.
	2.	Immediately refunding unused tokens: After joinPool executes, any excess tokens remaining in the contract are immediately returned to the user to prevent lockups.

The current implementation neither refunds unused tokens nor enforces an exact match between maxAmountsIn and the actual amount used.
