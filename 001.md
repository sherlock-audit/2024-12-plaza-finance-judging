# Malicious actors can DOS/discourage other users of bids

### Summary

Unoptimized bid function implementation will cause a Denial of Service for legitimate bidders as malicious actors will submit many small bids to make subsequent bid operations computationally expensive.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L177

### Root Cause

The choice to use an array for storing all bids is a mistake as each new bid requires iterating through all previous bids, leading to O(n) complexity.
This will cause a Denial of Service for legitimate bidders as malicious actors will submit multiple small bids to make transaction costs prohibitively expensive.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Attacker needs to have enough USDC to submit multiple bids
- Attacker needs to approve USDC spending to auction contract
- Auction needs to be active (not ended)
- Gas price needs to be low enough for attacker to afford multiple transactions

### External Pre-conditions

This attack has minimal external pre-conditions:
- there must be low amount of bets, so that gas price is low

### Attack Path

1. Attacker mints/acquires sufficient USDC
2. Attacker approves auction contract to spend USDC
3. Attacker calls auction.bid() with small bid amounts (~100 USDC) multiple times (50-100 times)
4. Legitimate bidder attempts to bid but transaction fails or costs too much due to high gas costs
5. Attacker effectively blocks auction participation or forces legitimate bidders to pay excessive gas fees

### Impact

Legitimate bidders are discouraged from participation in auctions effectively due to:
- Gas costs increasing by ~57% after 100 bids

### PoC
```solidity
  function testBidDOS() public {
        vm.startPrank(bidder);
        usdc.mint(bidder, 100000 ether);
        usdc.approve(address(auction), 100000 ether);
        
        uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();
        auction.bid(100 ether, 1000000000);
        uint256 gasUsed = gasBefore - gasleft();
        console.log("First bid gas used:", gasUsed);

        gasBefore = gasleft();
        auction.bid(100 ether, 1000000000); 
        gasUsed = gasBefore - gasleft();
        console.log("Second bid gas used:", gasUsed);

        for(uint i = 0; i < 97; i++) {
            auction.bid(100 ether, 1000000000);
        }
        
        gasBefore = gasleft();
        auction.bid(100 ether, 1000000000);
        gasUsed = gasBefore - gasleft();
        console.log("Last bid gas used:", gasUsed);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
### Mitigation

Change design to use mapping of address to bid.
