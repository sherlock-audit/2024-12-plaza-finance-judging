# Unfair Bidding by Late Bidders and Snippers Due to Bid Visibility in Contract

### Summary

The Bidding System used in the Auction.sol contract is such that every bid data is made public and bad actors simply need to wait close to the bidding end time to unfairly win bids based on the current bid data thereby undermining the bid process

### Root Cause

This issue is because bids are made public as noted at 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L48 without limitations to when new bids can be made as long as it is before end time.
```solidity
mapping(uint256 => Bid) public bids; // Mapping to store all bids by their index
```
And as can be noted in the bid function below no implementation is present to handle bidders who target end period
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L145
```solidity
  function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns(uint256) {
    if (sellCouponAmount == 0 || sellCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (buyReserveAmount == 0) revert BidAmountTooLow();
    if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh();

    // Transfer buy tokens to contract
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sellCouponAmount);

    Bid memory newBid = Bid({
      bidder: msg.sender,
      buyReserveAmount: buyReserveAmount,
      sellCouponAmount: sellCouponAmount,
      nextBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the end of the list
      prevBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the start of the list
      claimed: false
    });

    lastBidIndex++; // Avoids 0 index
    uint256 newBidIndex = lastBidIndex;
>>>    bids[newBidIndex] = newBid;
    bidCount++;
    â€¦
 }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

This unfair advantage would be possible when bid is close to end time

### External Pre-conditions

Attack simply needs to increase the current active bids by one or more token value

### Attack Path

Bad actor monitors the bid data closely and right before the bid closes bad actor bids with a value that is a little higher than the current lowest bid by just one or more token value.
This would unfairly displace the lowest bid without any repercussion for the late bidder

### Impact

When participants wait until the last moment to submit their bids in an attempt to gain an advantage this create and unhealthy bidding process and early bidders would be discouraged overtime. This kind of "sniping" and late bidding would create problem with fairness and would undermine the purpose of the auction.


### PoC

```solidity
function testLateBidder() public {
    uint256 initialBidAmount = 1000;
    uint256 initialSellAmount = 1000000000;

    // Create 1000 bids
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
      address newBidder = address(uint160(i + 1));
      vm.startPrank(newBidder);
      usdc.mint(newBidder, initialSellAmount);
      usdc.approve(address(auction), initialSellAmount);
      auction.bid(initialBidAmount, initialSellAmount);
      vm.stopPrank();
    }

    // Check initial state
    assertEq(auction.bidCount(), 1000, "bid count 1");
    assertEq(auction.highestBidIndex(), 1, "highest bid index 1");
    assertEq(auction.lowestBidIndex(), 1000, "lowest bid index 1");

    // Place a new higher bid at the end period
    address higherBidder = address(1001);
    uint256 higherBidAmountValue = 999; //just a little reduction in bid aim by just one token value
    uint256 higherSellAmountValue = 1000000000; 

    //Entering bid at the end minutes with great confidence of winning the bid without repercursion
    vm.warp(10 days - 1 minutes);
    vm.startPrank(higherBidder);
    usdc.mint(higherBidder, higherSellAmountValue);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), higherSellAmountValue);
    auction.bid(higherBidAmountValue, higherSellAmountValue);
    vm.stopPrank();

     // The Late Bidder gets in easily unfairly kicking out the previous bid winner at the end minute
    assertEq(auction.highestBidIndex(), 1001, "highest bid index 2");
  }
```
Test should be copied and pasted in Auction.t.sol 
[PASS] testLateBidder() (gas: 500781949)
Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 3.07s (3.03s CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 3.10s (3.07s CPU time): 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)

### Mitigation

Protocol could set bid mapping visibility to private to ensure bidders bid is kept private until the auction ends to prevent snipers from bidding unfairly, bids should only be visible to the auction system, and participants should not know the current status of the bidding until the auction ends. This reduces the opportunity for bidders to adjust their strategies based on what others are doing.
A second option is for protocol to incentivize early bidders with higher percentage value to encourage early bidders with lose to late bidders.
