# No check for if distributionPeriod has passed in `Pool::distribute`

### Summary

According to the documentation, the `Pool::distribute` can only be called after the distribution period has passed but there's no check to ensure that. The check present is a require statement to ensure that the currentPeriod > 0. This works for only the first period, 0, as the `startAuction` is what increases the current period and can only be called after the distribution period. But for subsequent periods, the check, require that the currentPeriod > 0, doesn't ensure that the distribution period has passed.
