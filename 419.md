# No checks for L2 Sequencer being down may cause OracleReader to return stale prices

### Summary

When fetching data from Chainlink `OracleReader` fails to check if the L2 sequencer is down.

When using Chainlink with L2 chains like Base, smart contracts should [check whether the L2 Sequencer is down](https://medium.com/Bima-Labs/chainlink-oracle-defi-attacks-93b6cb6541bf#0faf) to avoid stale pricing data that appears fresh.

### Root Cause

In [OracleReader::getOraclePrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L55-L76)  L2 sequencer checks are not implemented, which might cause it to return stale price

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

1. The sequencer is down

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates and this can be leveraged by malicious actors to gain unfair advantage.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a `ChainlinkOracleAdapter` and when the price is fetched do the checks inside of it
