# Incorrect fee accrual mechanism

### Summary

In `Pool` contract, it includes a fee mechanism that applies a specific fee ratio per year. However, this mechanism is not correctly implemented, causing discrepancy and unfairness before and after claiming fees.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is because expected amounts of fees are only calculated but not accrued in [_create](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L222) and [_redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L372) functions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The fee admin hasn't accrued the protocol fees for a while.

### External Pre-conditions

Creation and redemption of BondTokens and LeverageTokens are happening.

### Attack Path

- As an example, the fee ratio is setup as 10%, which is the maximum rate.
- The fee admin hasn't accrued fees for 1 year.
- The pool had 10 ETH, and a user has deposited 10 ETH right before the admin accrues fees, which makes it 20 ETH in the pool.
- Since the last fee updated time was 1 year ago, the fee admin accrues 2 ETH as fees.
- This behavior and fee accrual is pretty unfair for late depositors, because they pay 1 year fee by only staying in the pool for seconds.

### Impact

- Unfair fee accural to users.
- When deposit amount is bigger than redemption amount, the fee admin accrues more fees than expected, causing dropdown in `collateralLevel`.
- When redemption amount is bigger than deposit amount, the fee admin accrues less fess than expected, which is considered as loss to protocol.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

The protocol should accrue fees whenever the liquidity of the pool changes, which means in every event of creating and redeeming bonds. To accomplish this:

- Introduce a new state variable `totalFees`
- `simulateCreate` and `simulateRedeem` functions do not only return token amount but also return the fees accrued.
- In `_create` and `_redeem` functions, it should update `totalFees` based on the fees returned from simulation.
