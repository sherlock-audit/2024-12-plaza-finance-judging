# StablePool should be used instead of weightedPool in `BalancerOracleAdapter.sol`

### Summary

`BalancerOracleAdapter.sol` is using weightedPool for wstETH/stETH to calculate the price of LPs, but in balancer wstETH/stETH are considered as stable pool and not weightedPool. This will result in the wrong calculation of the price.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol#L99

`BalancerOracleAdapter.sol::latestRoundData()`:-

```javascript
    function latestRoundData() external view returns (uint80, int256, uint256, uint256, uint80) {
@>      IBalancerV2WeightedPool pool = IBalancerV2WeightedPool(poolAddress);
        .
        .
        .
    }
```

The reserveToken is going to be the pool of wstETH/rETH or wstETH/stETH but it is using weighted pool whereas in the balancer protocol we can see that it is begin considered as stable pool and not weighted.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Because of this it will calculate the price according to the weighted pool instead of stable pool. This will result in wrong price calculation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use StablePool instead of weightedPool in balancer for wstETH/stETH
