# Users Can Withdraw the Protocol Fee.


### Summary
When users sell their bondETH or levETH, the pool reserve decreases, which in turn reduces the protocol fee.

### Root Cause
This is because the protocol does not clear the fees before the user sells the token.
When calculating the price, the fee is deducted from the `poolReserve`, but this is not preserved in the current implementation.

```solidity
Pool.sol
    function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
719:    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
    }
```

### PoC
Assming: `poolReserve = 1200 ETH`, `fee = 2%`, `currenttime - lastFeeClaimTime = SECONDS_PER_YEAR/12`;
The current unclaimed fee would be: `1200 * 0.02  / 12 = 2 ETH`.
If users sell their bondETH or levETH amounting to 120 ETH, the new unclaimed fee would be: `1080 * 0.02 / 12 = 1.8 ETH.
As a result, users withdraw protocol fee amount of `(`2 - 1.8 = 0.2 ETH(>$600)`, leading to a loss of fess for the protocol.
The amount of lossing is greater than 1% of fees and more than 10$.

In sherlock doc:
>IV. How to identify a high issue:
>The protocol loses more than 1% and more than $10 of the fees.

### Impact
The protocol incurs a loss of fees.

### Mitigation
Consider changing the `claimFees()` function to something that anyone can call, and calling it before changing `poolReserve`.
