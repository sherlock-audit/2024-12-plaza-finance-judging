# User's shares are being wrong calculated causing a loss to the users

### Summary

The calculation of the shares that should be assigned to a user when minting bondETH is wrong since it does not take into account the new balance and incorrectly updates the period.

### Root Cause

The new bondETH balance is not taken into account and the period is updated incorrectly.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users lose shares, so they don't receive the correct payment.

### PoC

When a user mints new bondETH tokens the next function are called to mint the new tokens and update the shares the user is entitled.
the `create` function calls the `mint` function of the bondToken contract

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L125-L127
the internal `mint` function calls the `_update` function in the bondToken contract
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154-L164
Then the `updateIndexedUserAssets` function is called to update the shares the user is entitled and the period to the current period.

The `getIndexedUserAmount` function calculates the new amount of shares the user should have, but this function incorrectly uses the bondETH balance of the user before the new bondETH tokens are minted/assigned to the user balance, resulting in an incorrect shares calculation, additionally, the calculation of the shares is counting from the `lastUpdatedPeriod` to the previous period, no the current period as can be seen in the `for` cycle.

 then the `updateIndexedUserAssets` function incorrectly updates the `shares` (incorrectly calculated) and the `period` to the current period, when the `getIndexedUserAmount` function calculates the shares only until the previous period.

### Mitigation

Sent the `getIndexedUserAmount` function the updated bondETH balance of the user and also update the `for` cycle to calculate until the current period.
