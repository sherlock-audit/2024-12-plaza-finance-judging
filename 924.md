# First whale depositor can max out `reserveCap`

## Summary

A whale depositor can max out the `reserveCap` and withdraw it all at once before `depositEndTime` to prevent pool from being created.

## Vulnerability Details

In `PreDeposit._deposit`, there is currently no limit on the amount of `reserveTokens` that can be deposited by a single user. If a whale depositor gets hold of many reserveTokens, he can in principal max out the reserveCap in one transaction and withdraw it all at once before the `depositEndTime` to prevent the pool from being created in `PreDeposit.createPool`. This will render the PreDeposit's pool ability to create a pool useless.

Futhermore, `depositEndTime` cannot be changed once the the deposit window has closed.

In `PreDeposit._deposit`

```solidity
  function _deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) private checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
    if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached(); // @audit reverts if reserveCap exceeded

    address recipient = onBehalfOf == address(0) ? msg.sender : onBehalfOf;

    // if user would like to put more than available in cap, fill the rest up to cap and add that to reserves
    if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
      amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
    }

    balances[recipient] += amount;
    reserveAmount += amount; // @audit no limit on the amount of reserveTokens a single user can deposit

    IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    emit Deposited(recipient, amount);
  }

```

In `PreDeposit.createPool`

```solidity
  function createPool() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (reserveAmount == 0) revert NoReserveAmount(); //@audit reverts if reserveAmount = 0
    if (bondAmount == 0 || leverageAmount == 0) revert InvalidBondOrLeverageAmount();
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
    IERC20(params.reserveToken).approve(address(factory), reserveAmount);
    pool = factory.createPool(params, reserveAmount, bondAmount, leverageAmount, bondName, bondSymbol, leverageName, leverageSymbol, true);

    emit PoolCreated(pool);
    poolCreated = true;
  }

```

## POC

Consider the following scenario

1. Alice who has a huge number of `reserveTokens` notices a new `PreDeposit` contract is deployed.
2. She successfully becomes the first depositor and deposits the amount required to hit the `reserveCap`
3. This will mean subsequent users cannot deposit `reserveTokens` into the `PreDeposit` contract
4. Right before `depositEndTime` is reached, she successfully withdraws her full balance of `reserveToken`
5. Assume that after she takes out all her `reserveTokens`, no one else deposits during the short time until the `depositEndTime` is reached.
6. `PreDeposit.createPool` is now called but it reverts, since `reserveAmount = 0`

## Impact

`PreDeposit` loses its ability to create a pool, rendering the contract useless.

## Mitigation

Consider implementing a max number of `reserveTokens` that can be deposited for each user in a certain period of time.
