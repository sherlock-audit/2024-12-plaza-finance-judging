# Precision loss in `getRedeemAmount` calculation

### Summary

Incorrect placement of `PRECISION` will cause a precision loss issue for users redeeming LEVERAGE tokens as the protocol will calculate an incorrect `redeemRate` using the `getRedeemAmount` function.

### Root Cause

In the [`getRedeemAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L514) function, the calculation of `redeemRate` for LEVERAGE tokens performs division before multiplication with `PRECISION`. This order of operations leads to a loss of precision because the result of the division is truncated before being multiplied by `PRECISION`.

```solidity
uint256 redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

*   A user needs to redeem LEVERAGE tokens when the `collateralLevel` is greater than `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A user calls the `redeem` function with `tokenType` as `TokenType.LEVERAGE`.
2.  The `getRedeemAmount` function is called internally.
3.  The vulnerable `redeemRate` calculation is executed, resulting in a lower-than-intended `redeemRate` due to precision loss.
4.  The user receives fewer reserve tokens than they should upon redemption.

### Impact

Users redeeming LEVERAGE tokens will suffer a minor financial loss due to receiving a smaller amount of reserve tokens than expected. The magnitude of the loss depends on the specific values of `tvl`, `bondSupply`, `assetSupply`.

### PoC

The provided PoC demonstrates the precision loss using Chisel:

**Initial Values:**

*   `tvl = 253519373302500000000000`
*   `bondSupply = 150000000000000000000`
*   `PRECISION = 1000000`
*   `BOND_TARGET_PRICE = 100`
*   `levSupply = 20000000000000000000`
*   `assetSupply = levSupply`

**1. Current Implementation (Vulnerable):**

```solidity
uint256 currentRedeemRate =  ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION; 
// currentRedeemRate = 11925000000
```

**2. Corrected Calculation:**

```solidity
uint256 fixRedeemRate =  (((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / assetSupply);
// fixRedeemRate = 11925968665
```

**3. Difference:**

```solidity
fixRedeemRate - currentRedeemRate // Difference = 968665
```


### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, perform the multiplication with `PRECISION` *before* the division:

```solidity
uint256 redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / assetSupply;
```

This ensures that the full precision of the intermediate result is preserved, preventing the truncation that leads to the precision loss.
