# [M-01] Inconsistent onBehalfOf Logic in Pool.sol:_create() and Pool.sol:_redeem() Potentially Leads to Locked Funds

### Summary

The _create() and _redeem() functions in Pool.sol have inconsistent delegation logic, leading to security risks, potential loss of funds, and unauthorized fund transfers.

In _create(), users can mint tokens on behalf of another recipient (onBehalfOf), meaning the recipient receives the minted tokens instead of the caller.
In _redeem(), users must burn their own tokens (not on behalf of another recipient) but can still send the redeemed reserve tokens to any recipient.

Consequences of This Inconsistency:
1. A user can mint tokens for another address but cannot redeem on their behalf, leading to permanently locked funds if the recipient is a smart contract or an inactive user.
2. A user must redeem their own tokens, but they can send the reserve tokens to any recipient, allowing phishing attacks and social engineering exploits where attackers trick victims into redeeming to an attacker-controlled address.
3. The protocol does not enforce recipient authorization, meaning reserve tokens can be redirected without restrictions.

- _create() allows minting to any recipient via onBehalfOf.
- _redeem() requires the caller to burn their own tokens, not allowing burning on behalf of another user.
- _redeem() allows transferring reserve tokens to any address, breaking expected token ownership logic.

There is no consistent delegation mechanism for both minting and redeeming.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users can mint tokens on behalf of another user (onBehalfOf in _create()), meaning the recipient must later redeem them.
2. Users cannot redeem on behalf of another user, even if they minted the tokens for them.
3. Users can specify any recipient in _redeem(), redirecting funds arbitrarily.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A user mints tokens for another address (e.g., a smart contract or a friend).
2. The recipient is unaware that they must redeem the tokens themselves or cannot redeem due to contract limitations.
3. An attacker tricks the recipient into redeeming to an attacker's wallet via phishing or a malicious dApp.

### Attack Path

Scenario 1: Locked Funds
Victims: User A & User B
1. User A mints tokens for User B:
```solidity
_create(TokenType.BOND, 1000, 900, UserB);
```
2. User A supplies reserveToken.
3. User B receives the BOND tokens but does not realize they must redeem them.
4. User B is inactive or is a smart contract without a redemption function.

User A cannot redeem on behalf of User B, so the funds remain permanently locked.

Scenario 2: Unauthorized Fund Redirection
Victims: User A & User B | Attacker: User C
1. User A mints tokens for User B:
```solidity
_create(TokenType.BOND, 1000, 900, UserB);
```
2. User A supplies reserveToken.
3. User B receives BOND tokens.
4. User C (Attacker) tricks User B into redeeming to the attackerâ€™s wallet:
```solidity
_redeem(TokenType.BOND, 1000, 900, UserC);
```
5. User B burns their BOND tokens, thinking they will receive reserveToken. However, User C (attacker) is set as the recipient, so User C receives the reserve tokens instead. Funds are permanently lost.

### Impact

Locked of funds and unauthorized fund redirection.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict redeem to only the caller
```solidity
Pool.sol:#L428

- IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(recipient, reserveAmount); 
+ IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, reserveAmount);
```
