# Bond holders can claim shares for a given distribution prior to auction ending, making claimers from previous distributions unable to claim their entitled shares in case the auction fails

### Summary

Bond token holders can claim shares corresponding to a distribution whose auction is still ongoing. This can make holders from previous distribution who have still not claimed their corresponding shares to never be able to claim their corresponding rewards.

### Root Cause

When an auction is started for a given period, the global period tracker stored in the `BondToken` contract [is incremented](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/ab5bbd7d54042e4444b711a32def5b639fbd63b4/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L547) via the `increaseIndexedAssetPeriod` function:

```solidity
// File: Pool.sol

function startAuction() external whenNotPaused {
        ...

        // Increase the bond token period
        bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);

        ...
    }
```

Immediately after the auction has started, a new period gets added to the `globalPool.previousPoolAmounts` array in the `BondToken` contract. This makes the `getIndexedUserAmount` in the bond token compute the shares entitled to a given user up to the period for which the auction is still ongoing (included):

```solidity
// File: Pool.sol
function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }
```

In addition, the `claim()` function in the `Distributor` contract does not have any check in order to know if a user is claiming shares for a period whose auction has still not finished, given that it will simply fetch the corresponding shares for the user via the `getIndexedUserAmount` function:

```solidity
// File: Distributor

function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        ...
        uint256 shares = bondToken
            .getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
            .normalizeAmount(
                bondToken.decimals(),
                IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals()
            );

        ...

        couponAmountToDistribute -= shares;
        bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
        IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);

        emit ClaimedShares(msg.sender, currentPeriod, shares);
    }
```

This leads to a situation where users **can claim shares for a given period, even if the auction for that period fails.**

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:

1. User 1 and user 2 deposit some tokens in Plaza in period 1, and get 10 bond tokens each. When the time for period 1’s auction arrives, `startAuction` is called and the current period global tracker is incremented from 1 to 2. After the auction duration period, the auction concludes succesfully, and 50 USDC (2 users * 10 bond tokens each * 2,5 USDC per bond token as reward) are transferred to the distributor contract so that users can claim their rewards.
2. User 1 decides to claim their corresponding rewards for period 1, so he claims a total of 25 USDC. 25 USDC remain in the distributor contract.
3.  On the other hand, user 2 plans to keep holding bond tokens for a long time, and decides not to claim the USDC yet. After all, **there’s no obligation for him to claim the tokens, given that the contract logic should be able to provide him with the rewards at any point in time.** This is a strong requirement explicitly mentioned in [Plaza’s documentation](https://docs.plaza.finance/protocol-mechanics/claiming-coupons): *“Once a distribution occurs, a bondETH holder may claim their coupons at any point, whether they still hold the bond tokens or not.”.*
4. After some time, the time to trigger an auction for period 2 arrives. Both user 1 and user 2 are still holders of bond tokens. The auction process starts and the period is increased from 2 to 3. 
5. **Prior to the auction finishing,** user 1 decides to claim again in the distributor contract. ****Because at step 4 the global period tracker was incremented from 2 to 3, rewards corresponding to period 2 were **immediately unlocked for both user 1 and user 2** given that, as mentioned previously, `getIndexedUserAmount` fails to consider if an auction has finished or not. Because the current period is 3, the `getIndexedUserAmount` function returns another 25 USDC for user 1, so the user effectively claims the 25 additional USDC from the Distributor contract, reducing its balance from 25 USDC to 0 USDC.
6. Then, the auction for period 2 finishes, but this time the auction has failed. However, the `Distributor` contract has a 0 balance, and has allowed user 1 to claim two distributions, when in reality it should have prevented such claims, and should have only allowed user 2 to claim their corresponding rewards to period 1.

### Impact

As demonstrated in the “Attack path” section, allowing users to claim rewards for a given period before the auction of such period has finished is incorrect, and will lead to a loss of funds for certain users, given that some users could be claiming rewards that shouldn’t have been rewarded in the first place. The loss of funds can be substantial, given that some users will essentially lose most of their entitled rewards, which will be claimed by other users.

This unfair claims will not revert, as the user claiming prior to the auction finishing essentially gets tokens that actually correspond to rewards of other bond token holders that have decided not to claim at the moment (**note that, as mentioned before and highlighted in the documentation, users shouldn’t be forced to claim at any specific time and should always be able to claim their corresponding tokens).**

### Mitigation

Consider incrementing the distribution period **after** the auction finishes, instead of when it starts.
