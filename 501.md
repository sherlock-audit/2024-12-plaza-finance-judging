# Base mainnet ChainLink oracle is incompatible with `wstETH` causing issues for fetching the reserve token price

### Summary

The `Plaza` team plans to create `Balancer LP` pools using different underlying ETH derivates, one of which will be the `wstETH` token:

> If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?
Standard ERC20. Tokens allowed are set by governance. We will initially use tokens like WETH, USDC, wstETH, WBTC, cbBTC.

When the LP pool is created, they will use it to calculate the `Pool` contract's reserve token price, by fetching the ChainLink price of each underlying token and then applying some Balancer maths to retrieve the actual LP token price. However, Base's mainnet ChainLink oracle provider does not support direct conversion of `wstETH` to `USD`, as it first needs to be compared to either `stETH` or `ETH`, and then compared to `USD`. Currently, `BalancerOracleAdapter` supports only single asset prices, making it revert each time `wstETH` is queried for `USD` price.

    IBalancerV2WeightedPool pool = IBalancerV2WeightedPool(poolAddress);
    VaultReentrancyLib.ensureNotInVaultContext(IVault(pool.getVault()));
    (IERC20[] memory tokens,,) = IVault(pool.getVault()).getPoolTokens(pool.getPoolId());
    
    //get weights
    uint256[] memory weights = pool.getNormalizedWeights(); // 18 dec fractions
    uint256[] memory prices = new uint256[](tokens.length);
    uint8 oracleDecimals;
    for(uint8 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
      oracleDecimals = getOracleDecimals(address(tokens[i]), USD);
      prices[i] = getOraclePrice(address(tokens[i]), USD).normalizeAmount(oracleDecimals, decimals); // @audit - this will revert for wstETH as there is no chainlink price feed
    }

    uint256 fairUintUSDPrice = _calculateFairUintPrice(prices, weights, pool.getInvariant(), pool.getActualSupply());

    if (fairUintUSDPrice > uint256(type(int256).max)) {
      revert PriceTooLargeForIntConversion();
    }

    return (uint80(0), int256(fairUintUSDPrice), block.timestamp, block.timestamp, uint80(0));
  }
```

### Root Cause

There is no existing `wstETH/USD` Chainlink price feed on the Base mainnet, which makes the `BalancerOracleAdapter` incompatible with `wstETH` as an underlying token for the Balancer LP pool. Refer to [this](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=base&page=1&search=wstETH) to confirm there is no `wstETH/USD` price feed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Devs deploy the `PreDeposit` and `BalancerRouter` contracts before setting the price feeds.
2. Users start interacting with them, creating a `Pool`.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The Balancer Vault is created with `wstETH` as an underlying token.

### Attack Path

1. Users try to interact with `Plaza` either through the Pool directly, or the Router
2. They cannot create `bondETH` or `levETH` tokens as the create function reverts with `NoFeedFound` when trying to fetch the `reserveToken` price.

### Impact

1. Incompatibility of the Plaza system with the `wstETH` token as an underlying token for their Balancer LP vault.
2. As this issue will probably be confirmed at contract deployment time, if for some reason the dev team sets the price feeds at a later stage, e.g. after the Balancer Vault launch and the `PreDeposit` launch, this will lead to an unusable `Pool`, as whenever the reserve token price is fetched there will be a `NoFeedFound` revert.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Create a special bypass specifically for `wstETH` converting either to `stETH` or `ETH` first and then to `USD`.
