# `getOraclePrice()` does not validate returned prices

### Summary

`OracleReader.sol::getOraclePrice()` function validates the existence of the price feed but **does not check** the returned price. If the price feed returns a value of *close to 0* or an excessively low or high value that cannot realistically occur, the `OracleReader` contract will accept it as is.

Although Chainlink Price Feeds have their own `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` checks, as seen in the [implementation contract of the AAVE/USD feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0x547a514d5e3769680Ce22B2361c10Ea13619e8a9#readContract#F2) the [minAnswer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd8B9aA6E811c935eF63e877CFA7Be276931293DA#readContract#F23) is set to only `1`, and the [maxAnswer](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd8B9aA6E811c935eF63e877CFA7Be276931293DA#readContract#F22) is an extremely high value that is practically impossible to observe (`95780971304118053647396689196894323976171195136475135`). Therefore, Chainlink's built-in check is highly inadequate.

### Root Cause

As seen below, the `getOraclePrice()` function calls `AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData()` and uses the returned `answer` as is **without any further validation**:

```solidity
  function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns(uint256) {
    bool isInverted = false;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(quote, base);
    
    if (feed == address(0)) {
      feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(base, quote);
      if (feed == address(0)) {
        revert NoFeedFound();
      }

      // Invert the price
      isInverted = true;
    }
    (,int256 answer,,uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
    
    if (updatedTimestamp + OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).feedHeartbeats(feed) < block.timestamp) {
      revert StalePrice();
    }

    uint256 decimals = uint256(AggregatorV3Interface(feed).decimals());
    return isInverted ? (10 ** decimals * 10 ** decimals) / uint256(answer) : uint256(answer);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

To exploit it, given price feed needs to return a realistically unexpected price at any given time.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A close to 0 or extreme price feed value from the oracle could allow an attacker to drain pool reserves through token minting/redemption functions.

Since the unvalidated returned price directly determines token issuance and redemption rates via TVL calculations, using a corrupted price would allow tokens to be minted or redeemed at highly advantageous rates. 

### PoC

```md
Attack Scenario:

 1. Oracle returns a corrupt price 
 2. Attacker receives massively inflated amount of leverage tokens
 3. Once price normalizes, attacker redeems the leverage tokens for significantly more ETH than deposited
```

### Mitigation

Add checks in `getOraclePrice()` to validate that the returned price is within reasonable limits. Additional functions can also be added to change these values ​​later if desired.
