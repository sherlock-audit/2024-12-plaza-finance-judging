# Attacker can claim all bond and leverage tokens, due to logic in predeposit contract

### Summary

As we know that, user from predeposit contract can deposit reserve and will recieve bond and leverage token, on basis of their share percentage in the contract, and also there will reserve cap , upto that only user can deposit reserve tokens. Now attacker can use this in his favour and can manipulate the contract intended logic.

### Root Cause

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

attacker will deposit all tokens in the predeposit contract in such a way that, no one other user will able to deposit reserve tokens 

### Attack Path

Lets consider a scenario

Attacker will deposit upto max cap in predeposit contract. So now other user will not be able to deposit reserve tokens. 
And now attacker will withdraw nearbty max tokens from contract before it is going to end duration. And he will some reserve tokens as it is. So now new pool will be created by him with these much reserve tokens and all allocated bond and leverage tokens. So here he can claim all bond and leverage tokens , with this much reserve tokens. 

here he will get all bond and leverage tokens, but the case is, no other user will be able to claim this , as they were not able to deposit in predepsoit contract , so there will  be indirect loss of funds for user and protocol . And plus point is attacker can also get more rewards, which can be expected as 2.5e Share decimals. so here is there is benefit of attacker reward wise too.  

### Impact

pool will be created with non intended ratio and atacker can claim al leverage and  bond tokens with reserve tokens which they have left earlier

### PoC

some time before ( predecided like 10%  of total duration) no withdraw can take place and only deposit is allowed.
so even if attacker removes, other will have chance to deposit 

### Mitigation

withdraw should be blocked at the end  of predeposit duration. so even if attacker do something like this. he will not able to withdraw at end. and if he withdraw it. deposit should be open so other can deposit it
