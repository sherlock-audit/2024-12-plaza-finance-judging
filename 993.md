# Token with different decimals than 18 will calculate TVL and creationRate incorrectly because of the normalization

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L269-L273

We see that if target decimals are bigger than source decimals, the value is multiplied.

The tvl will be incorrectly calculated as much higher than what it is for tokens with lower decimals ~ WBTC, cbBTC. (8 decimals)

This becomes a pressing issue when the `creationRate` compares the USD value of the pool reserves with the expected value of the Bond Token. This would artificially make it seem much bigger and letting creationRate stay in its default high value

### Root Cause

The TVL is calculated by normalizing the token balance of the protocol with the COMMON Decimals. However it's used like the value is in USD in calculating `creationRate`. Which is wrong.

### Attack Path

1. Reserve Token with lower decimals than 18 is used
2. `poolReserves` are normalized making them bigger than they are 
3. TVL incorrectly calculated for normalized `poolReserves` , ``ethPrice * poolReserves / baseOracleAmount`` now does not say the USD price of the reserve amount
4. `creationRate` is calculated incorrectly as the numerator is tvl and denominator is already normalized from 18 decimals to 18. ``(tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;`` 
5. Add to it the `assetSupply` used in the denominator is already in 18 decimals making the comparison very unbalanced
6. Incorrect `creationRate` bigger than it should be ends up being used

### Impact

Wrong `creationRate` because of incorrectly calculated TVL for wBTC and cbBTC reserves.
It works as expected for ETH based reserves as those are 18 decimals.

### Mitigation

Do not normalize pool reserves for tvl calculation
