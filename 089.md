# Protocol loses fee because claimFees() does not claim the accumulated fees as promised

## Description
The functions [claimFees() and getFeeAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L697-L720) are supposed to allow the protocol to claim accumulated fees as mentioned in the comment:
```js
  /**
   * @dev Allows the fee beneficiary to claim the accumulated protocol fees.
   */
  function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
```

However `getFeeAmount()` calculates the fee on the _current_ balance of `reserveToken`:
```js
  function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }
```

This can result in the following issues:
### Issue1:
1. Suppose initial reserve token balance to be `10`.
2. User calls `create()` to mint some bond tokens and deposits `90` reserve tokens.
3. If fee is 10%, protocol would expect `10` if claimed.
4. `feeBeneficiary` calls `claimFees()`. Base has a [private mempool](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences#mempool-rules) (visible only to the Sequencer) so deliberate front-running is not an option but it could happen naturally that the user's redeem call executes first (due to higher fee offered). Also, in a live environment there would be multiple create & redeem actions going on by many users so `IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this))` is bound to fluctuate.
5. Suppose `50` reserve tokens worth of bond tokens are redeemed.
6. The `feeBeneficiary` receives only `10% of 50 = 5` reserve tokens.

It's not possible to claim the "_accumulated fee_" in the current protocol design.

### Issue2:
1. Let's assume the balance of reserve tokens to be a stable, static value throughout the year as `1000`.
2. Fee = `10%` for the full year.
3. **Case1:** `feeBeneficiary` calls `claimFees()` once at the end of the year. They receive `100` reserve tokens as fee. Works as expected.
4. **Case2:** `feeBeneficiary` calls `claimFees()` at the end of every 6 months i.e. twice in a year. First call results in them receiving `50` reserve tokens which is immediately transferred, leaving behing the remaining `950` tokens. When `claimFees()` is again called after 6 months, they receive `47.5` reserve tokens this time. Hence they lose `2.5` reserve tokens in fees. 
5. Greater the calling frequency of `claimFees()`, greater the loss.

### Issue3:
1. Suppose the fee has just been claimed and `lastFeeClaimTime` updated to the current `block.timestamp`.
2. Alice calls `create()` to have some tokens minted for some `inAmount`.
3. Some time passes and fee has accrued during this.
4. Alice wants to redeem but the accrued fees has pushed CL below threshold ( _or it could still be above threshold but Alice's redemption action will push it below threshhold. See  PoC for details_ ).
5. Alice receives lesser than `inAmount` when she redeems. She has to take a loss in spite of no price movement.
6. Conversely, a new user Bob can now get new bond tokens minted at a discounted rate because CL has been pushed below threshold.

## Impacts
1. Protocol loses fee because it's not possible to claim the accumulated fee in the current protocol design.
2. Protocol loses fee if claimFees() called multiple times for a given balance of reserve tokens.
3. CL can be pushed below threshold simply because of fee accrual over time. This harms existing token holders and benefits new users intending to mint bond tokens.

## PoC for Issue3
See this test pass when added inside `Pool.t.sol`:
```js
  function test_fee_redeem_bug() public {
    uint256 inAmount = 1000;

    uint256 TotalUnderlyingAssets = 1001000000;
    uint256 DebtAssets = 25000000000;
    uint256 LeverageAssets = 1000000000;
    
    vm.startPrank(governance);
    Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);

    // Mint reserve tokens
    rToken.mint(governance, TotalUnderlyingAssets * 2);
    rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), type(uint256).max);

    // Create pool and approve deposit amount
    uint i = 42;
    string memory salt = i.toString();
    Pool _pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(params, TotalUnderlyingAssets, DebtAssets, LeverageAssets, "", salt, "", "", false));
    useMockPool(address(_pool));
    rToken.approve(address(_pool), type(uint256).max);

    _pool.setFee(100000); // 10%

    Pool.PoolInfo memory current = _pool.getPoolInfo();
    uint256 currentTVL = (3000e8 * current.reserve).toBaseUnit(8);
    uint256 currentCL = (currentTVL * 1e6) / (current.bondSupply * 100);
    assertGt(currentCL, 1.2e6, "not above threshold!");
    
    uint256 amountBondTokens = _pool.create(Pool.TokenType.BOND, inAmount, 0);
    console2.log("\nbond tokens minted for 1000 =", amountBondTokens);
    current = _pool.getPoolInfo();
    currentTVL = (3000e8 * current.reserve).toBaseUnit(8);
    currentCL = (currentTVL * 1e6) / (current.bondSupply * 100);
    assertGt(currentCL, 1.2e6, "below threshold!");

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);

    current = _pool.getPoolInfo();
    currentTVL = (3000e8 * current.reserve).toBaseUnit(8);
    currentCL = (currentTVL * 1e6) / (current.bondSupply * 100);
    assertGt(currentCL, 1.2e6, "dipped below threshold!");

    // redeem now.
    // @audit-info : Although CL > threshold currently, this redemption action at normal rate will push 
    // CL below threshold, hence lower amount is allowed to be redeemed by the protocol logic
    uint256 amountOnRedeem = _pool.redeem(Pool.TokenType.BOND, amountBondTokens, 0);
    console2.log("redeem amount received        =", amountOnRedeem);
    assertLt(amountOnRedeem, inAmount, "we expected a loss");
  }
```

## Mitigation 
A better apporach would be to accrue fees at the time of create() & redeem() or any other fee generating functions, storing them in a separate state variable, rather than calculating them based on the current balance at claim time. This would ensure fees are properly attributed regardless of balance fluctuations.
