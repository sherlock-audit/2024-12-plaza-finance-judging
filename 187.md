# Pool sale limit can be set greater than 95%

### Summary

Plaza doc states that pool sale limit must not be greater than 95%.

> A new auction is created, and the system sets a 10-day period for participants to bid for ETH related assets using USDC. A portion of the underlying assets (like wstETH) in the pool are made available for bidding, **not to exceed 95% percent** of the value of the pool.

However this restraint is not enforced in code implementation

### Root Cause

There is no check max pool sale limit allowed in Pool::setPoolSaleLimit (there is only a min check that revert if newly set pool sale limit is below 90%)
