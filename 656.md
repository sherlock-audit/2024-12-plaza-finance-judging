# Attacker will trap all Users Funds in the PreDeposit Contract in a Griefing Attack

### Summary

Attackers can create an unlimited number of `PreDeposit` contracts that act as "good-investments" and entice users to transfer their tokens to the contract. When the deposit period is about to end, the attacker will set the `bondAmount`, or `leverageAmount` as `0` and cause everyone to lose their investments. Users will be unable to withdraw their tokens, nor will the pool be created (because the `createPool` function will revert everytime). Hence, they gave their tokens in exchange for nothing. 

Attackers will be able to create an unlimited number of such honey pot contracts because owners do not need a minimum investment in their own contract. Alternatively, attackers can also invest a small amount of tokens to give confidence to investors, and withdraw them as they set their `bondAmount` or `leverageAmount` as `0`. 

It is almost guaranteed that rival protocol will do this to impact the credibility of this protocol. 

### Root Cause

If a user wants to create a `Pool`, they will first create a `PreDeposit` contract that accepts "investments" in the form of their chosen `reserveToken`. Then, after a set period they will call the `createPool` function to create a new `Pool` with the `reserveToken` they received. 

A major condition in the [`PoolFactory::createPool`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PoolFactory.sol#L124) function is that the `reserveAmount`, `bondAmount`, and `leverageAmount` can not be `0`. 

```solidity
function createPool(
    ...
    if (bondAmount == 0) {
      revert ZeroDebtAmount();
    }

    if (leverageAmount == 0) {
      revert ZeroLeverageAmount();
    }
```

On the other hand, the [`PreDeposit::setBondAndLeverageAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L204) allows the `owner` of the `PreDeposit` contract to change the `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount` to any value they want. 

```solidity
function setBondAndLeverageAmount(uint256 _bondAmount, uint256 _leverageAmount) external onlyOwner checkDepositNotEnded {
  if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();

  bondAmount = _bondAmount;
  leverageAmount = _leverageAmount;
}
```

This means that an attacker can seek a lot of investments and change the `bondAmount` or `leverageAmount` into `0`, and entrap all users and their tokens resulting in a 100% loss of tokens for users.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates a `PreDeposit` contract that will accept `reserveToken` of their choice (e.g. wETH). 
2. Attacker sets the `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount` just as a normal pool would to help it appear normal. 
3. Just before the `depositEndTime`, the attacker sets the `bondAmount` or `leverageAmount` as `0` (either one, or both). This fully entraps the users and their tokens. 
4. Users will try to use the `withdraw` function, but it uses the `checkDepositNotEnded` modifier which will not allow the withdrawal of the tokens. 
5. Anyone can call the `createPool` function, but it will revert because the `bondAmount` or the `leverageAmount` is `0`. 

This fully traps all the tokens of the users in the PreDeposit contract. The fact that the owner does not need to personally invest any token into the contract to pull off this attack further increases the possibility of this attack. 

### Impact

The users will lose `100%` of their investments. 

### PoC

Add the following test script in the `PreDeposit.t.sol` file: 

```solidity
function test_trapUserTokens() public { 
    deployFakePool();

    // Setup initial deposit
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    reserveToken.approve(address(preDeposit), DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
    preDeposit.deposit(DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
    console.log("user1 deposited %e", DEPOSIT_AMOUNT); 
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Create pool
    vm.startPrank(governance);
    preDeposit.setBondAndLeverageAmount(0, 0);
    console.log("bond and leverage set to 0 right as the deposit period is about to end"); 
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 8 days); // After deposit period

    poolFactory.grantRole(poolFactory.POOL_ROLE(), address(preDeposit));
    vm.expectRevert(); 
    preDeposit.createPool();
    console.log("pool can not be created"); 
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Claim tokens
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    uint256 balanceBefore = preDeposit.balances(user1);
    vm.expectRevert(); 
    preDeposit.withdraw(DEPOSIT_AMOUNT); 
    console.log("user1 is unable to withdraw their tokens"); 
    
    console.log("user1 balance still in preDeposit contract %e", balanceBefore); 
    
    vm.stopPrank();
  }
```

When you run this script using `forge test --mt test_trapUserTokens -vvv` you get the following logs: 
```bash
Logs:
  user1 deposited 1e19
  bond and leverage set to 0 right as the deposit period is about to end
  pool can not be created
  user1 is unable to withdraw their tokens
  user1 balance still in preDeposit contract 1e19
```

This test script shows how users after being trapped will not be able to withdraw their investments using the `withdraw` function, and that the `PreDeposit` contract holds all the user's tokens without a way to reach it.
