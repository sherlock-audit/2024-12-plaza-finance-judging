# When Creating and Redeeming, the Protocol Fee is Not Updated

### Summary

The protocol deducts a fee from TVL over time using the formula: `TVL * (current time - last time) * fee percent`.

Therefore, the protocol fee should be updated whenever TVL changes. However, even though creating and redeeming affect TVL, the protocol fee is not updated.

### Root Cause

The [getFeeAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L719) function calculates the fee amount based on TVL and the time elapsed since the last fee claim.

Thus, whenever TVL changes, the accrued fee amount and `lastFeeClaimTime` should be updated. However, while creating and redeeming affect TVL, they are not updated. As a result, fee calculations will be incorrect.
```solidity
      function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
719     return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
      }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

1. Current State of the Pool:
    - `TVL`: $1000
    - `lastFeeClaimTime`: 2025.1.1
2. Bob Buys Tokens with `$200` on `2025.1.11`:
    - `TVL`: $1200
    - `lastFeeClaimTime`: still 2025.1.1
3. At `2025.1.21`, the Protocol Claims Fee:
    - fee amount: `$1200 * 20 days`

However, Bob's `$200` was deposited only 10 days ago, not 20 days. So, the actual fee amount should be calculated as: `($1000 * 20 days) + ($200 * 10 days)`.

As a result, Bob's `$200` pays twice as much in fees.

### Impact

The incorrect fee calculation causes a loss for users.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Whenever creating and redeeming, `lastFeeClaimTime` should be updated, and the protocol fee should be adjusted accordingly.
