# Attacker can make Pool unusable by dropping totalSupply to 0.

## Bug description
When creating bondETH or levETH tokens, `getCreateAmount()` function reverts if supply of either of the tokens is 0. 

[Pool.sol#L314-L316](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L314-L316)
```solidity
if (bondSupply == 0) {
    revert ZeroDebtSupply();
}
```

[Pool.sol#L330-L332](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L330-L332)
```solidity
if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
    revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
}
```

This allows an attacker to make the contract unusable. First an attacker would deposit an amount to fill the `reserveCap` in the preDeposit contract, so no other deposits could be made.

[PreDeposit.sol#L119](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L119)
```solidity
if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached();
```

This would make him the only owner of bondETH and levETH tokens after `createPool()` is called and he claims his tokens. Now this user first redeems his levETH and then redeems bondETH reducing totalSupply of both tokens to 0, making the contract unusable.

## Root cause
An ability of a single user to obtain all of the supply of bondETH and levETH.

## Attack path
1. In PreDeposit contract attacker deposit reserve tokens up to `reserveCap` to obtain all of the supply of both tokens.
2. When the main Pool launches, attacker immediately redeems all of the levETH and bondETH reducing totalSupply of both tokens to 0.
3. No new tokens can be deposited making the Pool unusable.

## Impact
An attacker can make the contract unusable by obtaining all of the supply of bondETH and levETH using PreDeposit contract and subsequently reducing totalSupply of both tokens to 0.

## Recommended Mitigation
Enforce a `maxBuy` limit for single user in PreDeposit contract or handle special cases when totalSupply of either of the tokens is 0.
