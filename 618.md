# Unbounded Loop in `getIndexedUserAmount` Causes Denial of Service due to Gas Limits

### Summary

The `BondToken.sol::getIndexedUserAmount()` function iterates through all periods between a user's `lastUpdatedPeriod` and the current period to calculate accumulated shares. This implementation has an unbounded loop that processes every historical period sequentially, causing the function to exceed block gas limits when too many periods accumulate. Since this function is called by `_update()` which is required for all token transfers, users who hold tokens across many distribution periods will eventually be unable to transfer their tokens due to out-of-gas errors, effectively locking their funds in the contract.

### Root Cause

The overridden `_update()` function calls the `updateIndexedUserAssets()` function for the `from` and `to` users (only `to` for `mint`, and `from` for `burn`). This function retrieves the shares using the `getIndexedUserAmount()` function, where the root cause of the bug lies:

```solidity
function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user needs to be inactive for a long period of time.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `getIndexedUserAmount` function's unbounded loop through `period`s creates a DoS vulnerability for token's `_update()` function which is called in `transfer`, `mint` and `burn`. When a user holds tokens across many distribution periods, the gas cost to process all historical shares exceeds block gas limits, making tokens permanently untransferable for the user. This effectively locks user funds in the contract, as all transfer operations require processing the complete history of share distributions through the `_update()` function.

### PoC

The following Proof of Concept will result in reverting due to out of gas during transfer (use `--block-gas-limit` when executing):
```solidity
function testGasLimitInGetIndexedUserAmount() public {
        vm.startPrank(minter);
        token.mint(user, 1000);
        vm.stopPrank();

        (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = token.globalPool();
        emit log_named_uint("Current Period Before Loop", currentPeriod);
        
        vm.startPrank(governance);
        for(uint i = 0; i < 420; i++) { // Increment period with some shares
            token.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(200);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        (uint256 currentPeriod2, ) = token.globalPool();
        emit log_named_uint("Current Period After Loop", currentPeriod2); 

        vm.startPrank(user);
        token.transfer(address(1), 10);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```


### Mitigation

The `getIndexedUserAmount` function should implement a checkpoint system or try an alternative solution.
* Store accumulated shares at regular intervals (e.g., every 50 periods)
* Only iterate through periods since last checkpoint.
* Add checkpoint update function.
