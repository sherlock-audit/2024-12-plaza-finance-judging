`BalancerRouter.sol::joinBalancerPool()`:-

```javascript
    function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns (uint256) {
        .
        .
        .
        (, int256 answer,, uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
        .
        .
        .
    }
```

While fetching the price from chainlink it doesn't check for the L2 sequencer uptime and doesn't wait for the grace period to over as recommended by chailink.
