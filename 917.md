# An attacker can intentionally prevent the auction from succeeding by placing a bid that makes the `totalSellReserveAmount` exceed the sale limit just before bidding ends.

## Summary
A malicious bidder can intentionally bid an amount that causes the `totalSellReserveAmount` to exceed the sale limit, leading to the auction failure (`FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`). 

## Vulnerability Details

An attacker can intentionally prevent the auction from succeeding by placing a bid that causes the `totalSellReserveAmount` to exceed the pool's sale limit just before the auction ends.

There is no check in the bidding function to prevent users from placing a bid that causes the `totalSellReserveAmount` to exceed the pool's sale limit. An attacker could exploit this by bidding just before the auction ends, causing it to enter the `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` state every time.

```solidity
function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
        if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();
        
        if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
            state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
@>        } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
@>            state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
        } else {
            state = State.SUCCEEDED;
            Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
            IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
        }

        emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
    }
```


## Impact
Preventing the auction from succeeding each time.

## Recommendations
Place a check in the bidding function or in the removeExcessBids function to ensure that the bid, when added to the `totalSellReserveAmount`, does not exceed the pool's sale limit. This will prevent an attacker from exploiting the vulnerability.
