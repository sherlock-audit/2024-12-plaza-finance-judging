# Malicious bidder can DoS bids by getting blacklisted in USDC

### Summary

The auction process can be DoS’ed if a malicious bidder gets blacklisted in USDC.

### Root Cause

When bidding, some of the already inserted bids will be removed in two situations:

- If the `bidCount` exceeds `maxBids`. In this case, the lowest bid will be removed. This is done via the [`_removeBid` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L325), which deletes the bid and sends the corresponding coupon tokens to the bidder.
- If  `totalBuyCouponAmount` is reached. In this case, bids will be removed from the lowest to the highest, until there is no excess between the coupon deposited amount and the needed `totalBuyCouponAmount` for the auction. There’s two ways to remove a bid in this case:
    - If the bid can be fully removed, `_removeBid` will be triggered
    - Otherwise, the proportional refund amount will be computed, and the contract will transfer the coupon tokens to the bidder.

In both scenarios, the coupon tokens are directly transferred to the corresponding bidder.

```solidity
// File: Auction.sol
function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
		Bid storage bidToRemove = bids[bidIndex];
    ...

    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);

    ...
  }
```

```solidity
// File: Auction.sol

function removeExcessBids() internal {
    ...

    while (currentIndex != 0 && amountToRemove != 0) {
      ...

      if (amountToRemove >= sellCouponAmount) {
        ...      
        } else {
        ...
        
        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove); 
        
        amountToRemove = 0;
        emit BidReduced(currentIndex, currentBid.bidder, currentBid.buyReserveAmount, currentBid.sellCouponAmount);
      }
    }
  }
```

The problem with this approach is that the bidding functionality could be DoS’ed if the bidder whose bid is to be removed gets blacklisted in USDC, given that USDC in Base [includes a Blacklisting functionality](https://basescan.org/address/0x2ce6311ddae708829bc0784c967b7d77d19fd779#code#F1#L22).

If the bidder is blacklisted, trying to refund the tokens won’t work and will revert, thus DoS’ing further bids, and preventing the bidding functionality from functioning.

### Attack Path

1. User 1 places a bid in the Auction contract, depositing some USDC. For example, he places a bid when the max bids have been reached, and he becomes the lowest bid.
2. Then, user 1 gets blacklisted in USDC.
3. After that, all subsequent bids that try to be added to the bids list will try to remove user 1’s bid (given that it is the lowest bid). This process will try to directly transfer back the corresponding USDC to user 1. However, because he is blacklisted, the whole function will revert, effectively preventing further bids from being placed.

### Impact

Medium. The bidding functionality can be DoS’ed, effectively preventing further bids from being placed. This can have a high impact, as in some scenarios bids could be prevented from being succesful. For example:

1. 1000 bids have already been placed, but the `totalBuyCouponAmount` still has not been reached. 
2. User 1 places a bid so that it is the lowest of all 1000 bids included.
3. User 1 gets blacklisted.
4. Further bids won’t be possible, as trying the bid will revert. After the auction period passes, the auction will fail, given that it was not possible to reach the expected `totalBuyCouponAmount` to pay bond holders.

### Mitigation

Implement a pull-over-push pattern. Instead of transferring the USDC to bidders, store the amount that should be refunded in a mapping, and allow bidders to claim that amount.
