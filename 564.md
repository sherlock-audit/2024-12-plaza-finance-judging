# Risk of DoS During Auction Bidding Due to USDC Blacklisted Bidders

### Summary

The `Auction::bid` function removes old or low-value bids when the maximum bid limit is reached or the required coupon amount is exceeded. This is achieved through the `removeExcessBids` and `_removeBid` functions, which attempt to refund the coupon amount to removed bidders. However, if `buyCouponToken` is USDC (as expected during protocol launch) and a bidder is blacklisted, the refund fails due to USDC's blacklist mechanism. This causes a denial-of-service (DoS), preventing new bids and potentially leading to auction failure.  

### Root Cause

In `Auction::bid`, the following vulnerabilities exist:  
- The `safeTransfer` function in `_removeBid` and `removeExcessBids` is used to refund `buyCouponToken` to removed bidders. If the bidder is blacklisted (e.g., by USDC), the transfer reverts. This blocks bid removal and halts further bidding.  

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A token with a blacklist mechanism, such as USDC, is used as the `buyCouponToken`.  
2. The auction reaches the maximum number of bids (e.g., 1000) or exceeds the required coupon amount.  

### External Pre-conditions

1. A bidder participates in the auction using USDC as the `buyCouponToken`.  
2. The bidder's address is blacklisted during the auction. 

### Attack Path

1. A bidder places a bid using USDC.  
2. The bidder's address is blacklisted after their bid is accepted.  
3. Subsequent bids trigger the removal of older bids when the bid limit is exceeded.  
4. If the blacklisted bidder has the lowest bid, `_removeBid` fails as `safeTransfer` reverts.  
5. This results in a complete DoS, preventing other users from submitting new bids.  

**Note:** This scenario also applies when the required coupon amount is exceeded. In such cases, `removeExcessBids` attempts to refund the blacklisted bidder, causing the same issue. 

### Impact

The issue can have two possible outcomes:  

### Best-Case Scenario  
The auction has already reached the required coupon amount before the DoS occurs. In this case:  
- The auction can be finalized.  
- Bondholders receive their rewards.  
- The primary consequence is that new bidders cannot participate.  

### Worst-Case Scenario  
The auction reaches the maximum bid limit without meeting the required coupon amount:  
- No new bids can be added.  
- The auction fails to accumulate the necessary funds.  
- Bondholders do not receive rewards, leading to financial loss.  

### PoC

The [`Auction::bid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L153-L161) function calls `removeExcessBids` for every new bid and `_removeBid` when the bid limit is exceeded:  

```solidity
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) 
    external 
    auctionActive 
    whenNotPaused 
    returns (uint256) 
{
    ...
    if (bidCount > maxBids) {
        if (lowestBidIndex == newBidIndex) {
            revert BidAmountTooLow();
        }
        _removeBid(lowestBidIndex);
    }

    // Remove and refund out-of-range bids
    removeExcessBids();
    ...
}
```  

Both [`_removeBid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L324-L325) and [`removeExcessBids`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L268-L286) attempt to refund `buyCouponToken` to removed bidders using `safeTransfer`. If the bidder is blacklisted, the transfer fails:  

```solidity
function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
    ...
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount); 
    ...
}

function removeExcessBids() internal {
    ...
    if (amountToRemove >= sellCouponAmount) {
        // Subtract the sellAmount from amountToRemove
        amountToRemove -= sellCouponAmount;

        // Remove the bid
        _removeBid(currentIndex);

        // Move to the previous bid (higher price)
        currentIndex = prevIndex;
    } else {
        // Calculate the proportion of sellAmount being removed
        uint256 proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount;
        
        // Reduce the current bid's amounts
        currentBid.sellCouponAmount = sellCouponAmount - amountToRemove;
        currentCouponAmount -= amountToRemove;

        uint256 reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18);
        currentBid.buyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount - reserveReduction;
        totalSellReserveAmount -= reserveReduction;
        
        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
        
        amountToRemove = 0;
        emit BidReduced(currentIndex, currentBid.bidder, currentBid.buyReserveAmount, currentBid.sellCouponAmount);
    }
}
```  

Given USDC's blacklist mechanism, this issue can occur even if the blacklisted user is not malicious, potentially disrupting the protocol. 

### Mitigation

Adopt a pull-based refund mechanism instead of pushing tokens to bidders. When a bid is removed:  
1. Update the bid's state to allow the bidder to withdraw their tokens (e.g., add a `canWithdraw` field to the `Bid` struct).  
2. Introduce a `refundBidDuringAuction` function, enabling bidders to claim their refunds manually.  

This approach prevents DoS by ensuring that blacklisted addresses do not block the auction.
