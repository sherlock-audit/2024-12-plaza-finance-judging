# Invalid tick calculation in `latestRoundData` can cause oracle failure.


### **Root Cause**  
The [vulnerable function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L99-L114) :
```solidity
int24((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int56(uint56(twapInterval)))
```  
The `latestRoundData` function calculates the average tick by dividing the difference between `tickCumulatives[1]` and `tickCumulatives[0]` by the `twapInterval`, assuming the result will always fall within the valid `int24` range (±8,388,607). However, this assumption is flawed because cumulative ticks from [ICLPool.observe](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L107) are unconstrained and can be large due to high market volatility or long TWAP intervals. When the calculated tick exceeds this range, the subsequent call to `TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick` reverts, as it enforces strict input bounds. For example, with a `twapInterval` of 3600 seconds and cumulative ticks like `10^12` and `10^11`, the calculated tick would be `250,000,000`, which far exceeds the `int24` limit. This guaranteed revert breaks the oracle, rendering it unusable for protocols reliant on price data during such scenarios. The lack of a boundary check on the tick value directly causes this issue.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. The `twapInterval` must be non-zero and set by the `initialize` function.  
2. The `tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]` difference must produce a value that, when divided by `twapInterval`, results in a tick exceeding ±8,388,607.  

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
1. A pool tracked by the oracle must observe an extreme price movement or an extremely volatile market condition, resulting in a large tick cumulative difference.  
2. The `observe` function of the `ICLPool` contract must return valid but extreme cumulative tick values.  

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A user queries the oracle by calling `latestRoundData`.  
2. The contract calls `observe` on the `ICLPool` to retrieve tick cumulative values for the TWAP interval.  
3. The contract calculates the tick value using the difference in cumulative ticks divided by `twapInterval`.  
4. If the result exceeds the range of `int24`, the call to `TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick` reverts.  
5. The oracle fails to return a price, disrupting any dependent systems or users.  

---

### **Impact**  
This causes the `latestRoundData` function to fail, rendering the oracle unusable if extreme tick values are observed over the TWAP interval.

---

### **Mitigation**  
Add a validation step to ensure the calculated tick value is within the `int24` bounds before passing it to `TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick`.
