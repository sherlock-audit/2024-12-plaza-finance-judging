# Insolvency will make Bond holders unable to redeem their assets

### Summary

In [`Auction::endAuction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336C1-L350C4) function, the contract checks if the `totalReserveAmount` is greater than `poolBalance * poolSaleLimit`. However, there will be a new balance during each auction, making it less likely for the check to revert until the `poolBalance` becomes very small. 

Assume the initial `PoolBalance` is `1,000BPT` and the limit is `10%:` `100BPT`
First auction checks if `totalReserveAmount` is bigger than `100BPT`, assume the `totalReserveAmount` is `90` and the auction passes. Now the `poolBalance` is `910` and the `poolSaleLimit` is: `91BPT`

If `totalReserveAmount` in the second auction is not up to `91BPT`, say `90BPT`, the auction again passes. This will continue until `poolBalance` reduces to an amount that will revert. And considering the fact that more user may deposit assets along the line, this will continue. 

Finally, since there is no way to replace the `reserveAssets` sold in auction, there will not be enough assets for users to redeem. 

```js
      function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
        if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();
    
        if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
          state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
@>        } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
            state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
        } else {
          state = State.SUCCEEDED;
          Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
          IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
        }
    
        emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
      }
```
