# Users will lose minted token amounts due to ignored return values in `LifiRouter`

### Summary

Unhandled return value in LifiRouter's `create()` function will cause a complete loss of token amount tracking for users as the router ignores the actual minted token amounts returned by `Pool.create()`, leading to potential accounting discrepancies and lost token tracking.


### Root Cause

In [src/LifiRouter.sol#L11-19](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/LifiRouter.sol#L11-L19) the `create()` function ignores the `uint256` return value from `Pool.create()` which represents the actual amount of tokens minted, preventing any tracking or verification of minted amounts.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to approve `LifiRouter` contract for `reserveToken` spending
2. User needs to call `create()` function with valid pool address and parameters
3. Pool contract needs to be in non-paused state
4. Pool contract's `create()` function must successfully mint tokens

### External Pre-conditions

None, as this is an internal protocol issue.

### Attack Path

1. User approves `LifiRouter` for X amount of reserveToken
2. User calls `router.create()` with parameters:
   - `pool` address
   - token type (BOND/LEVERAGE)
   - `minAmount`
   - deadline
   - `onBehalfOf` address
3. Router fetches `reserveToken` address from `pool`
4. Router calls `Pool.create()` with user's allowance
5. `Pool` contract mints tokens and returns amount
6. Router ignores returned amount, leaving no record of actual minted tokens

### Impact

The protocol and users lose ability to track actual minted token amounts. This leads to:
- No way to verify if correct amount of tokens were minted
- Lost accounting of token creation history
- Potential discrepancies between expected and actual minted amounts
- Difficulty in auditing or tracking token creation events

### PoC

```solidity
contract TestLostMintAmount {
    function testMintAmountLoss() public {
        address pool = address(new Pool());
        uint256 allowance = 1000e18;
        uint256 minAmount = 100e18;
        
        // Approve router
        IERC20(reserveToken).approve(address(router), allowance);
        
        // Create tokens
        router.create(
            pool,
            Pool.TokenType.BOND,
            minAmount,
            block.timestamp + 3600,
            address(this)
        );
        
        // At this point:
        // 1. Tokens were minted
        // 2. Return value was ignored
        // 3. No way to know actual minted amount
        // 4. Could be anywhere between minAmount and maximum possible
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
function create(
    address _pool,
    Pool.TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 minAmount,
    uint256 deadline,
    address onBehalfOf
) external returns (uint256 mintedAmount) {
    address reserveToken = Pool(_pool).reserveToken();
    uint256 allowance = IERC20(reserveToken).allowance(msg.sender, address(this));
    
    // Store and return minted amount
    mintedAmount = Pool(_pool).create(
        tokenType,
        allowance,
        minAmount,
        deadline,
        onBehalfOf
    );
    
    // Emit event for tracking
    emit TokensCreated(_pool, msg.sender, onBehalfOf, mintedAmount);
    
    return mintedAmount;
}
```
