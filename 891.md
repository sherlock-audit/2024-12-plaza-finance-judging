# Auctions succeeding condition does not take into account the claimable fees in the pool. It can result of a drastical reduction of claimable fees if auction succeeds, or cause an auction to fail if the fees are claimed

### Summary

One of the condition for an auction to succeed is to have the [total bet of `reserveToken` be less than or equal to 90%](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341) (or higher, set by admin) of the pool's balance to ensure tokens are transfered.

This calculation does not take into account the amount of fees claimable by the beneficiary, and can result in two issues :

- When an auction succeeds, it gets from the pool the amount of tokens users bet. This will drastically reduce the fees claimable from the beneficiary as it lowers the pool's balance, which is linked to fees calculation.

- If an auction should succeed by having the total of reserveToken bid being on the lower edge of the 90% of pool's token amount, and the fees are claimed, then the auction may fail if the reserveToken bid become higher than the newly calculated 90% to tokens in the pool.

### Root Cause

Auction does not includes the claimable fees when calculating the reserve amount it can receive

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

### Attack path 1

1. An auction is created and the condition for it to succeed are met (with an average total amount of `reserveToken` bid)
2. The amount of fees claimable are equal to X
3. The function `Auction::endAuction` is called and the auction succeeds, taking `reserveToken` from the pool
4. The amount of fees claimable are now lower than X

### Attack path 2

1. An auction is created and the condition for it to succeed are met (with a high total amount of `reserveToken` bid, near 90%)
2. The fees are claimed
3. The function `Auction::endAuction` is called and the auction ends in the state `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` because the bids are higher than allowed amount of `reserveToken`

### Impact

Drastic reduction of fees claimable and potential auction ending in an unsuccessful state

### PoC

> To get the amount of fees claimable from the pool, set the visibility of the function `Pool::getFeeAmount` to public

Copy this poc in Auction.t.sol and run it

        uint256 maxReserveTokenClaimable = (IERC20(auction.sellReserveToken()).balanceOf(pool) * auction.poolSaleLimit()) / 100;

        // 1. The auction can succeed, and will rewards users for almost the pool's claimable amount
        vm.startPrank(bidder);

        usdc.mint(bidder, maxUSDCToBid);
        usdc.approve(address(auction), maxUSDCToBid);

        // 2. The fees are claimed
        vm.prank(governance);
        Pool(pool).claimFees();

        // 3. Ending the auction fails it
        auction.endAuction();

### Mitigation

Include the claimable fees when calculating the total sell token limit at the end of an auction, or allocate an amount of tokens for an auction when the auction is created.
