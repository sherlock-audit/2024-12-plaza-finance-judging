# Attacker is able to manipulate the pool balance such that the auction succeeds

### Summary

After the auction period ends ,lets consider [totalSellReserveAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341C16-L341C39) is greater than `IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100` meaning auction `state` should be `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` .But attacker able to increase the pool reserve token amount with flash loan. Here attacker able to call [create](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L192)  with flash loan by doing he is able to increase the ReserveToken pool balance in such that `totalSellReserveAmount < (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100`    .  Due to this , auction state becomes `State.SUCCEEDED`. Then attacker able to withdraw his flash loan amount with [redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L353) function. 

### Root Cause

```solidity 
function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {  //@auditInfo :(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool)  able to manipulated with flashloan. 
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

### Attack Path

Consider auction is end and , `totalSellReserveAmount` is hit the `poolSaleLimit` so that auction should be ended `state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;` . Here attacker front run the `endAuction` with flash loan.  
1.  Attacker able to increase the pool reserve token amount with flash loan. Here attacker able to call [create](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L192)  with flash loan in a such a way that `totalSellReserveAmount < (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100` 
2.  Invoked `endAuction` function. Here auction state is changed to `state = State.SUCCEEDED;`
3.  Invoked `redeem`  function to get back the flash loan. 

### Impact

If `totalSellReserveAmount` is hit the `poolSaleLimit` then auction should be failed. (`state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;`) . But here with flash loan attacker able to manipulate the pool balance such a way that state to be SUCCEEDED.

### Mitigation

Use state variable for Reserve token pool balance instead for [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341C68-L341C77)
