# `Auction::endAuction` will be reveretd because of `Pool::transferReserveToAuction`

### Summary

`Auction::endAuction` will be reveretd because of `Pool::transferReserveToAuction`

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L579

### PoC

`Pool::startAuction` is callable by everyone after distribution period and when that will be called a new auction contract will be deployed for current period and then current period will be increased one unit by `BondToken::increaseIndexedAssetPeriod` and `Auction::endAuction` is callable by everyone after auction period and when `Auction::endAuction` will be called if currentCouponAmount is equal with totalBuyCouponAmount
and totalSellReserveAmount is less than 90%[sale_limit and that is configurable] of pool reserve `Pool::transferReserveToAuction` will be called but `Pool::transferReserveToAuction` gets auction for current period which isn't correct, previous period id should be used instead of current period id

### Impact

Coupon tokens will be stuck in auction contract because auction remain in bidding mode when currentCouponAmount is equal with totalBuyCouponAmount
and totalSellReserveAmount is less than 90% of pool reserve

### Mitigation

```diff
     (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
-    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
+    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod - 1];
     require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
     
     IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
```
