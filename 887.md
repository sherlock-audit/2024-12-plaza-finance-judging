# Manually setting the value `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount` in `PreDeposit` may result in unwanted reserve to token ratio.

### Summary

Users can deposit and reach the reserveCap and Admins set the bondAmount and leverageAmount accordingly, but at the very end moment users can withdraw all their funds and createPool with the existing bondAmount and leverageAmount. This may result in unwanted ratio of reserve and bond/leverage amount as admins sets the amount based on the amount users had deposited.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L136

`PreDeposit:withdraw()`:-

```javascript
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
        if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        reserveAmount -= amount;

        IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);

        emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

```javascript
    function setBondAndLeverageAmount(uint256 _bondAmount, uint256 _leverageAmount)
        external
        onlyOwner
        checkDepositNotEnded
    {
        if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();

        bondAmount = _bondAmount;
        leverageAmount = _leverageAmount;
    }
```

`bondAmount` and `leverageAmount` are set by the admins instead of dynamically calculating them.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

unwanted ratio of reserve and bond/leverage, as a result users will get more bond/leverage tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

sets `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount` dynamically inside `PreDeposit::createPool()` based on the total reserveToken deposited.
