# Failed auctions cannot be properly rolled over

### Summary

every period a certain amount of coupon tokens are meant to be given to the holders of bond tokens at that period 
the mechanism for this as explained by the docs and implemented int he code is to auction some reserve tokens and use the received coupon tokens to pay the token holders.

If the auction fails however, the token holders would be forced to lose their tokens from that period as there is no efficient rollover mechanism implemented in the codebase 

when an auction is created
1. it always create an auction for the current period if there isnt one already 
2. it automatically increases the current period in the bond token contract 

this means that an auction can not be created twice for the same period cause creating at period x means the next auction will be created at x + 1

this means if the auction for token at period x fails, distribute() can never be called for that period x again  

simply sending the tokens to the coupon tokens doesnt work because the function allocate has to be called
the option of increasing shares per token for the auction of x + 1 to cover for x doesnt work because then the holders would just be owed more tokens for period x + 1 

eg 
 share per token at x = 10 
 total supply at x = 100 
an auction starts for 1000 coupon tokens, the auction fails 
users are owed 1000 tokens in total 
protocol  increases shares per token to 20 =x + 1 to cover for both x + 1 and x 
total supply is the same
the next auction will try to acquire 2000 tokens 
at this point however the debt is 1000 * 10 + 1000 * 20 = 3000 


### Root Cause

once an auction has been created for a period, it can never be recreated, even if it fails 


### Internal Pre-conditions

auction fails 

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

users would either lose their coupon tokens for the failed auction period

### PoC


### Mitigation

create mechanism to recreate an auction for a period if the previous one failed
