# abi.encodePacked() will cause hash collisions for dynamic types

### Summary

The use of abi.encodePacked() with dynamic types will cause potential hash collisions for the affected contract as an attacker may exploit this issue by providing inputs that produce the same hash value.

### Root Cause

In Solidity, using abi.encodePacked() with dynamic types (such as strings or arrays) leads to improper padding, which causes different inputs to have the same hash output. This issue arises because abi.encodePacked() does not pad values to 32 bytes, allowing hash collisions, whereas abi.encode() properly pads the values.

In the contract, abi.encodePacked(0x123, 0x456) could produce the same hash as abi.encodePacked(0x1, 0x23456), which may lead to security vulnerabilities in the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract uses abi.encodePacked() to hash dynamic types like strings or arrays.
The attacker knows how to provide different input values that produce the same hash output.

### External Pre-conditions

No external changes are required for the vulnerability to exist, as it depends on the contract's internal code logic.

### Attack Path

The attacker inputs different dynamic types into the contract using abi.encodePacked().
The contract hashes these inputs, leading to hash collisions.
The attacker exploits the collision for potential malicious behavior, such as bypassing security checks.

### Impact

The contract suffers from potential hash collisions, which could allow an attacker to bypass key operations like signature verification, authentication, or other security checks, leading to unauthorized access or contract malfunction.

### PoC

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HashCollisionExample {
    function checkHashCollision() public pure returns (bytes32) {
        bytes32 hash1 = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(0x123, 0x456));
        bytes32 hash2 = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(0x1, 0x23456));
        return (hash1 == hash2) ? hash1 : bytes32(0);
    }
}
