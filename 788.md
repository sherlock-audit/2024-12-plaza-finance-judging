# bid() will result in a denial of service (DoS) attack if the bidder address is on the blacklist.

### Summary

buyCouponToken is USDC, The current USDC contract implements a blacklist through the notBlacklisted(address)
modifier which only allows transferring/minting USDC from/to addresses that are not blacklisted.

### Root Cause

```javascript
 function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
    //skip
    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
@>    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);

    emit BidRemoved(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);

    delete bids[bidIndex];
    bidCount--;
  }
```

```javascript
function removeExcessBids() internal {
    //skip
        
        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
@>      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
        
        amountToRemove = 0;
        emit BidReduced(currentIndex, currentBid.bidder, currentBid.buyReserveAmount, currentBid.sellCouponAmount);
      
    
  }
```
Throughout the entire auction process, there are multiple scenarios where buyCouponTokens need to be refunded to the bidder. However, if the bidder's address is on the blacklist, it will cause a DoS attack on the entire bid() function, preventing users from continuing to bid.


### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

the `bidder` address is in blacklist

### Attack Path

The auction lasts for multiple days (e.g., 10 days), so it's entirely possible that a bidder's address, which was not on the blacklist when they first participated in the bidding, could be added to the blacklist after a short period, potentially causing a DoS attack on the entire bidding function.

### Impact

The bidding function has completely failed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of refunding buyCouponTokens via push mode, we should adopt pull mode.
