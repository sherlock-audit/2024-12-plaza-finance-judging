# Erroneous fee calculation in Pool

### Summary

The fee calculation mechanism in the `Pool` contract can lead to inflated fees. Currently, fees are calculated based on the total time elapsed since the last fee claim time  and the current `poolReserves`. This approach fails to account for the fact that `poolReserves` can increase due to user deposits  between fee claims.  As a result, the calculated fee can include a portion of the deposited amount, effectively charging more fees (when computing `poolReserves `for the next users more than the intended fee percentage.

### Root Cause

The fee calculation issue lies in how `poolReserves` is adjusted within the `simulateCreate` (and `simulateRedeem`and `getFeeAmount()` ) function ([Pool.sol#L273](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273)):

```solidity
poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
```

This line of code subtracts the calculated fee directly from `poolReserves` based on the time elapsed since the last fee claim (`lastFeeClaimTime`).  While this attempts to account for accumulated fees, it creates a problem because `lastFeeClaimTime` is only updated within the `claimFees` function.  This means that subsequent calls to `simulateCreate` or `simulateRedeem` will use the *same* outdated `lastFeeClaimTime` but `poolReserves` will change, consequently an inaccurate fee amount.  The fee is effectively calculated multiple times on the same interval time, resulting in an overestimation of the actual fee due. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  The `fee` must be greater than zero.
2.  A user call `deposit()`, increasing `poolReserves`.
3.  The `claimFees()` function must not be called immediately after the deposit.
4.  A subsequent deposit or redemption occur before `claimFees()` is called.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Users suffer a loss as more fees are deducted from the `poolReserves` than intended. This results in less `bondToken` or `lToken` being minted for users during `create()` and less `reserveToken` being returned during `redeem()`.

### PoC

This PoC demonstrates the inflated fee calculation issue using a simplified example and calculations using chisel.

As shown above, the `poolReserves` were updated after the first deposit. However, `lastFeeClaimTime` remains unchanged.  This means the fee calculation in `getFeeAmount` uses the updated `poolReserves` (including the deposit) and the entire time elapsed since the initial `lastFeeClaimTime`.  This results in an inflated fee (`feeDeductedAfterFirstDeposit`) compared to the fee that should have been accumulated (`feeDeductedBeforeFirstDeposit`).  The difference represents the excess fee erroneously attributed to the period after the first deposit. This demonstrates how the current implementation calculates the fee based on an inflated `poolReserves` value.


### Mitigation

Introduce a variable (e.g., `protocolFee`) to accumulate the fees deducted during each `create()` and `redeem()` operation.
Transfer the accumulated `protocolFee` to the beneficiary in the `claimFees()` function and reset `protocolFee` to zero. Update `lastFeeClaimTime` after each successful fee deduction.

```solidity
uint256 private protocolFee;

function _calculateProtocolFee(
    uint256 poolReserves,
    uint256 annualRate,
    uint256 timeElapsed
) internal pure returns (uint256 feeAmount) {
    feeAmount = (poolReserves * annualRate * timeElapsed) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
    protocolFee += feeAmount;
    return feeAmount;
}

function simulateRedeem(TokenType tokenType, uint256 depositAmount) public view returns(uint256) {
    // ... (rest of the code)

    uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime;
    poolReserves -= _calculateProtocolFee(poolReserves, fee, timeElapsed);
    lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp; // Update lastFeeClaimTime

    // ... (rest of the code)
}

function simulateCreate(TokenType tokenType, uint256 depositAmount) public view returns(uint256) {
    // ... (rest of the code)
    uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime;
    poolReserves -= _calculateProtocolFee(poolReserves, fee, timeElapsed);
    lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp; // Update lastFeeClaimTime
    // ... (rest of the code)
}

function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return protocolFee;
}

function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
    // ... (rest of the code)
    uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime;
   uint256 poolReserves = IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this);
   _calculateProtocolFee(poolReserves, fee, timeElapsed);
  lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp; // Update lastFeeClaimTime
    uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();

    // ... (rest of the code)

    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
    protocolFee = 0; // Reset protocolFee
    emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
}

```
