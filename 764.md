# Auction will be dosed forever in case remainder of division TotalBuyCouponAmount/maxBids != 0

### Summary

Main idea about auction design is Auction has slots with limited coupon(usdc) weight.
For example if we need to auction 10 000 usdt and maxBids = 1 000, then each slot will have 10 usdc weigh.
Meanwhile usdc amount to be auction is arbitary amount we clarify depends of shares per bond and amount of Bonds. Since Bond erc20 with 18 decimals and shares per bond can be picked randomly it is very likely we end up in situations where TotalBuyCouponAmount/maxBids != 0 and this remainder will be rounded down. 

simple math:

1) it was 333 333 333 usdc (333 without decimals) to distribute
2) maxBids currently set as 1000
3) now we clarify slot weight by TotalBuyCouponAmount/maxBids . It will be 333333.333, remainder round down because of solidity.
4)now each slot has 333333, meaning 1 000 of slots will gather 333 333 000 amount, which is lower then 333 333 333

In such situation we have 0 chances for auction to be reach required coupon amount, it will always fail 

### Root Cause

Pool.sol   startAuction()
```solidity

  auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
      address(new Auction()),
      abi.encodeWithSelector(
        Auction.initialize.selector,
        address(couponToken),
        address(reserveToken),
        couponAmountToDistribute,
        block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
        1000,
        address(this),
        poolSaleLimit
      )
    );
```
