# Precision loss in `redeemRate` calculation

### Summary

In `getRedeemAmount` function of `Pool` contract, `redeemRate` calculation formula mistakenly multiply by `PRECISION` at the end, which causes the precision loss.

### Root Cause

On the line [Pool.sol#L514](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L514), it applies the multiplication by `PRECISION` at the end.

### Internal Pre-conditions

`collateralLevel` is bigger than `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`.

### External Pre-conditions

A user tries to redeem `LeverageToken`.

### Attack Path

**Assmption**

- 1 `ETH` = 1000 USD
- Total supply of bond token = 1e18
- Total supply of leverage token = 10e18
- The pool has `0.1234` ETH

**Redemption Steps**

- A user tries to redeem 1 leverage token, which is 1e18 including decimals
- `collateralLevel` = 1.234 > 1.2
- `redeemRate` = `((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION` = ((1234e17 - 1e18 * 100) / 1e19) * 1e6 = (234e17 / 1e19) * 1e6 = 2 * 1e16
- As a result, the price of leverage token is calculated as 2 USD, but it has to be 2.34 USD.

### Impact

Because of the precision loss during redemption, users who redeem leverage tokens receive less reserve tokens than they deserve, which is considered as loss for users.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

The formula for `redeemRate` has to be modified so that it applies multiplication before division.

```diff
- redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
+ redeemRate = (tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION / assetSupply;
```
