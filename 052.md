# Wrong rounding of TWAP when `tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]` is negative

### Summary

For the TWAP calculation, the difference between the two tickCumulatives is calculated. This value is divided by the `twapInterval` to obtain the time-weighted average tick.

Given that Solidity division truncates the result, the effect of this truncation is different depending on the sign of the result of `tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]`. If `tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]` is positive, a truncation will decrease the value of the tick. However, if `tickCumulativeDelta` is negative, truncating its value increases the value of the tick.


### Root Cause

Solidity's integer division behavior causes asymmetric rounding in TWAP calculations when handling positive versus negative price movements. While dividing by twapInterval, positive price changes are rounded down (truncated) while negative changes are effectively rounded up (truncated toward zero), creating a systematic bias in price calculations depending on the direction of the price movement.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Creates a discrepancy in the calculated TWAP value depending on the sign of `tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]`

### PoC

For positive deltas: truncation rounds down (e.g., 3.8 -> 3)
For negative deltas: truncation also rounds towards zero (-3.8 -> -3)...The value is increased

### Mitigation

```diff
-       uint160 getSqrtTwapX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(int24((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int56(uint56(twapInterval))));
+       int56 tickCumulativeDelta = tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0];
+       int24 timeWeightedAverageTick = int24(tickCumulativeDelta / int56(uint56(twapInterval)));
+       if (tickCumulativesDelta < 0 && (tickCumulativesDelta % int56(uint56(twapInterval)) != 0)) {
+           timeWeightedAverageTick--;
+       }
+       uint160 getSqrtTwapX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(timeWeightedAverageTick);
```
