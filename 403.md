# Pool contract charges fees even if it's paused

### Summary

Fee amount from `reserveToken` in the `Pool` contract is calculated depending on the `block.timestamp` and `lastFeeClaimTime` and does not count time when contract was paused leading to **unfair fee claiming** by `feeBeneficiary`.

### Root Cause

[Pool.getFeeAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L718) using `block.timestamp` and `lastFeeClaimTime` for `feeAmount` calculation without considering time when contract was paused:
```Solidity
/**
  * @dev Returns the amount of fees to be claimed.
  * @return The amount of fees to be claimed.
  */
function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
  return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
}

/**
  * @dev Allows the fee beneficiary to claim the accumulated protocol fees.
  */
function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
  require(msg.sender == feeBeneficiary || poolFactory.hasRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE(), msg.sender), NotBeneficiary());
  //@audit calculation of feeAmount
  uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();
  
  if (feeAmount == 0) {
    revert NoFeesToClaim();
  }
  
  lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
  IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
  
  emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Pool contract was paused for some time

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Protocol takes unfair `feeAmount` of `reserveToken` from users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It's more fair to take `feeAmount` when user either depositing his `reserveTokens` or redeeming it.
