# `simulateRedeem` calculates only the `marketRate` of `bondToken` and then uses it for both Bond and Leverage type tokens

### Summary

`Pool::simulateRedeem` is intended to calculate the `marketRate` for both Bond and Leverage tokens which is then used in future calculations in `getRedeemAmount`, which calculates the amount of tokens the user redeems based on the token type. 

```javascript
uint256 marketRate;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(address(bondToken), USD);
    if (feed != address(0)) {
@>    marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD)
        .normalizeAmount(
          getOracleDecimals(address(bondToken), USD), 
          oracleDecimals // this is the decimals of the reserve token chainlink feed
        );
    }

    return getRedeemAmount(
      tokenType,
      depositAmount,
      bondSupply,
      levSupply,
      poolReserves,
      getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD),
      oracleDecimals,
@> marketRate
    ).normalizeAmount(COMMON_DECIMALS, IERC20(reserveToken).safeDecimals());
  }
```
However, the leverage token is completely ignored here. marketRate should be calculated based on the token type(either leverage or bond token). Currently, `marketRate` is calculated only for the bond token and used for both bond and leverage tokens. 

### Root Cause

In `Pool::simulateRedeem` the marketRate wrongly calculates only the bond market rate.

### Impact

Protocol will calculate the wrong market rate for the leverage token, which market rate plays a role in the calculation of the final redeem amount for the user. This could lead to either loss/gain of funds for both the user and the protocol


### Mitigation

Add an "if" statement to check whether the token type is bond or leverage and calculate the market rate based on the type.
