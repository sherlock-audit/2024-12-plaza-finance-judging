# Integer Overflow in getIndexedUserAmount

### Summary

The math operation inside getIndexedUserAmount can lead to an overflow if the values are very big, due to lack of proper math checking.

### Root Cause

In BondToken.sol:177, the shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS); uses toBaseUnit which multiplies before dividing, and can lead to overflow.

### Internal Pre-conditions

balance, globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken must be large enough to cause an overflow when multiplied.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

The user has a large balance.

The user calls getIndexedUserAmount.

The multiplication overflows.

### Impact

The integer overflow can lead to incorrect calculations of indexed user assets, leading to inaccurate results when getting the user's amount.

### Mitigation

Use SafeMath libraries or check for overflows before doing the math operation. Consider avoiding the use of toBaseUnit, or have safe checks before doing the math operation.
