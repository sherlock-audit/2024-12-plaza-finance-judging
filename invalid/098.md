# Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow in removeExcessBids()

### Summary

Unchecked arithmetic operations will cause unexpected behavior for bidders as an attacker will manipulate the math operations to break the auction.

### Root Cause

In Auction.sol:250 there is an uncontrolled math operation uint256 proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount; that can lead to an overflow.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A malicious user needs to bid in the auction

The bid must be a bid that is being removed by removeExcessBids().

The amountToRemove or sellCouponAmount values must be large enough to cause an overflow with the multiplication

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

The attacker places a bid that will be removed by removeExcessBids().

During the removal of the bid in removeExcessBids() there will be an overflow due to big values in amountToRemove or sellCouponAmount.

This leads to an incorrect value of proportion, and this can break the logic of the auction, leading to wrong refunds.

### Impact

The calculation error leads to wrong refunds.

             auction.bid(1, totalBuyCouponAmount - 1);

             auction.bid(1, 1);

}

### Mitigation

Use SafeMath or implement checks to avoid integer math overflow/underflow.
