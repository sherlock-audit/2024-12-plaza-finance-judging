# Missing Validation in setParams, setBondAndLeverageAmount and increaseReserveCap

### Summary

The functions setParams, setBondAndLeverageAmount and increaseReserveCap lack proper input validation.

### Root Cause

In PreDeposit.sol:170, the function setParams checks if the token is not zero, and if the token is the same as the previous one, but there is no validation on the other parameters in the struct.

In PreDeposit.sol:183, the setBondAndLeverageAmount allows any value for bondAmount and leverageAmount.

In PreDeposit.sol:193 the increaseReserveCap allows any value for newReserveCap that is bigger than reserveCap.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The owner inputs incorrect values.



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

An owner or a malicious contract calls setParams, setBondAndLeverageAmount or increaseReserveCap with incorrect values.

The contract stores the incorrect values.

The following calculations will be affected by this change.

### Impact

Wrong values stored in the state can lead to unexpected behavior or reverts during the calculations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add proper input validation in all the setters.
