# Auction bug causes premature failures, impacting participants and owners.

### Summary


In the `Auction` contract, there is an **arithmetic error** in the logic that checks whether the `totalSellReserveAmount` exceeds the pool sale limit.

### Affected Line
- [Auction.sol#L341](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance-shipkata494/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341)

### Root Cause

The calculation of the pool sale limit uses an incorrect divisor:
```solidity
(IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100
```
The correct divisor should be **10000** because `poolSaleLimit` is expressed in basis points.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The auction is in progress and has reached a point where the `endAuction()` function is triggered.
- `totalSellReserveAmount` is calculated based on the bids placed during the auction.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user submits bids that increase the `totalSellReserveAmount` to a value close to the incorrectly calculated pool sale limit.


### Attack Path

1. The auction operates normally until the `endAuction()` function is executed.
2. Due to the incorrect divisor, the calculated pool sale limit is much smaller than intended.
3. This triggers the condition for `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`, resulting in unintended auction failures.


### Impact

1. **Incorrect Auction Outcomes:**
   - Auctions may fail prematurely due to an incorrectly calculated pool sale limit.
   - Legitimate bids might be rejected or ignored.

2. **Economic Consequences:**
   - Users could lose opportunities to participate in auctions.
   - The auction could fail to distribute tokens as expected.


### PoC

The following test case demonstrates the issue:

### Incorrect Logic
1. Set `poolSaleLimit = 95000` (95%).
2. Call `endAuction()` when:
   ```solidity
   totalSellReserveAmount = 950 * IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) / 1000; // Expected limit
   ```
3. Due to the incorrect divisor, the condition fails because the pool sale limit is calculated as 950% instead of 95%.


### Mitigation

Update the logic in the `endAuction()` function to use the correct divisor:
```solidity
} else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 10000) {
    state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
}
```
