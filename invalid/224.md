# Issue H-1: Unauthorized Withdrawal Exploit (Forced Deposits Withdrawable)

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L118
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L136

The ability to withdraw tokens without verifying original deposit ownership will cause unauthorized token withdrawals for legitimate users or the protocol as victims of forced deposits will withdraw tokens they never deposited.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L136

In the function  the `PreDeposit::withdraw` function allows any address to withdraw tokens based solely on their balance in the protocol, without verifying the legitimacy of how those tokens were deposited. 

An attacker can exploit this by:
Forcing a deposit onto a victim's address using deposit(amount, victim)
The victim can then withdraw these tokens, even though they never approved or initiated the deposit
This creates a situation where tokens can be moved without proper authorization from their original owner.

```solidity
  function withdraw(uint256 amount)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    checkDepositStarted
    checkDepositNotEnded
{
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    reserveAmount -= amount;
    IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
}

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1.Attacker forces tokens to be deposited to a victim's address.

2.The victim withdraws the tokens they never deposited.

3.Since the attacker was the original depositor, they essentially lose control of the tokens they deposited, but the victim gains access to tokens for free.This process creates a drain on the protocolâ€™s reserves, as tokens are withdrawn without proper economic participation.

4. When the victim withdraws the tokens, they effectively take tokens out of the protocol's reserves without having participated economically (i.e., without depositing any value).

### Impact

This  flaw enables attackers to unintentionally "gift" tokens to victims, who can then withdraw them freely. This breaks the protocol's economic assumptions and depletes its reserves without proper checks and balances.

    preDeposit.deposit(depositAmount, victim);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Step 3: Check victim's protocol balance
    assertEq(preDeposit.balances(victim), depositAmount);
    assertEq(reserveToken.balanceOf(victim), 0);

    // Step 4: Victim withdraws tokens they never deposited
    vm.startPrank(victim);
    preDeposit.withdraw(depositAmount);

    // Step 5: Check victim's token balance post-withdrawal
    assertEq(reserveToken.balanceOf(victim), depositAmount);
    assertEq(preDeposit.balances(victim), 0);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Step 6: Attacker has lost tokens without benefiting
    assertEq(reserveToken.balanceOf(attacker), initialBalance - depositAmount);
}

### Mitigation


Remove the onBehalfOf Parameter in  all the deposit functions, forcing users to deposit only for themselves.

or 
Add Authorization Checks: Implement a mapping to track approvals for third-party deposits.
add this to `PreDeposit` function 

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public depositApprovals;

function approveDepositor(address depositor) external {
    depositApprovals[msg.sender][depositor] = true;
}

function deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) external {
    require(onBehalfOf == msg.sender || depositApprovals[onBehalfOf][msg.sender], 
        "Not authorized to deposit");
    _deposit(amount, onBehalfOf);
}


```
