# Missing Input Validation in increaseIndexedAssetPeriod

### Summary

The function increaseIndexedAssetPeriod does not validate the new sharesPerToken. If it's a zero value, it will lead to issues in the calculations and it's very difficult to correct this value after it's been set.

### Root Cause

In BondToken.sol:203 the increaseIndexedAssetPeriod function doesn't check if the input sharesPerToken is correct.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The input sharesPerToken is zero.



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

An owner or a malicious user calls increaseIndexedAssetPeriod with sharesPerToken equals to zero.

The globalPool.sharesPerToken is set to zero.

### Impact

All calculations involving globalPool.sharesPerToken after this call will be affected by this change.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add checks to ensure the new sharesPerToken is valid before setting it in the contract.
