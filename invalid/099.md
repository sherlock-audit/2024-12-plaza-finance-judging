# Reentrancy Vulnerability via Malicious Pool

### Summary

The reliance on VaultReentrancyLib.ensureNotInVaultContext will cause a potential reentrancy for the callers as a malicious pool can trigger calls to the oracle.

### Root Cause

In BalancerOracleAdapter.sol:96 the latestRoundData() function uses VaultReentrancyLib.ensureNotInVaultContext(IVault(pool.getVault())); which uses the IVault, but this check is not sufficient to prevent a reentrancy via a malicious pool.

The contract makes external calls to the Balancer pool (pool.getNormalizedWeights, pool.getInvariant, pool.getActualSupply) that can be controlled by a malicious actor.

### Internal Pre-conditions

the poolAddress is set to a malicious contract.

The malicious contract implements the IBalancerV2WeightedPool interface

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

A user or contract calls latestRoundData().

The contract calls VaultReentrancyLib.ensureNotInVaultContext() which prevents a direct reentrancy through the vault.

The contract calls IBalancerV2WeightedPool(poolAddress) to get pool data and a malicious pool can call latestRoundData() again during the calculations of the pool data.

The call stack is not protected against reentrancy by a malicious pool.

The data retrieved from the pool can be manipulated to cause issues in the calculations and prices.

### Impact

A malicious pool can cause unexpected behavior in the calculations, and potentially cause a denial of service.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply a standard reentrancy guard that uses a state variable and not relying on an external contract like VaultReentrancyLib or an external vault.
