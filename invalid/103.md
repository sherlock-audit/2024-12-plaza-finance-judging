# Potential Reentrancy in _update Function

### Summary

The call to super._update after updating user balances can cause a reentrancy by a malicious token.

### Root Cause

In BondToken.sol:140, the _update function updates user assets before calling super._update(from, to, amount). A malicious ERC20 token with a callback on transfer, can call back to the BondToken and the state can change during the transfer

### Internal Pre-conditions

A malicious token with a callback on transfer.

The user transfers tokens using the malicious token.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

A user transfers amount of malicious tokens, from from to to, in the BondToken contract using a malicious contract.

The BondToken._update is called.

The user assets are updated in the BondToken.

super._update(from, to, amount) is called, which will trigger the malicious token to call back to the BondToken before the BondToken._update finishes, changing the state variables, like userAssets and globalPool.

### Impact

The reentrancy vulnerability could lead to incorrect balances, double-counting of shares, or other unexpected behavior in the token logic.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply the check-effects-interactions pattern, by making the call to super._update before changing any state variable.
