# Price Manipulation via Balancer Pool Data

### Summary

 The use of data from an external pool without validation will cause a manipulation of the price for the users as a malicious pool can control the values

### Root Cause

In BalancerOracleAdapter.sol:115 the _calculateFairUintPrice() function uses data from the Balancer Pool: prices, weights, invariant, and totalBPTSupply. These values are not validated and if any of them are manipulated, the final price can be manipulated

### Internal Pre-conditions

The poolAddress points to a pool controlled by the attacker.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

the attacker deploys a malicious pool contract that implements the IBalancerV2WeightedPool interface.

The attacker sets the poolAddress in the BalancerOracleAdapter to the address of the malicious pool.

When latestRoundData() is called, the malicious pool returns manipulated values of weights, invariant, and totalBPTSupply.

The _calculateFairUintPrice function calculates the price based on manipulated values, returning an incorrect price to the caller.

### Impact

The oracle provides an inaccurate price, which can be exploited to cause financial loss to users relying on this oracle.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that the poolAddress is a trusted pool, if it's possible, or have some validations for the returned values.
