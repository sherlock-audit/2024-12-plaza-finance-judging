# Division by Zero Check Bypass

### Summary

The library is supposed to revert if the denominator is zero, but it can be bypassed, which leads to an incorrect behavior.

### Root Cause

In FullMath.sol:28, and FullMath.sol:119, the require only checks that denominator > prod1 which can be bypassed if prod1 is 0 and denominator is 0, this will lead to a division by zero in result := div(prod0, denominator) or in the mulmod operation of mulDivRoundingUp.



### Internal Pre-conditions

The input denominator is zero and prod1 is zero.



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

The user inputs denominator zero and inputs in a, and b which will lead to a prod1 that is zero, which bypasses the require in FullMath.sol:28, then a division by zero in FullMath.sol:34.

### Impact

This can cause a division by zero and lead to unexpected behaviors.

              0,
             0
            );

    }


    function testDivisionByZeroRoundingUp() public {
         vm.expectRevert();
       FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
               0,
               0,
                0
            );
    }
}

### Mitigation

Add a check to ensure the denominator is never zero.
