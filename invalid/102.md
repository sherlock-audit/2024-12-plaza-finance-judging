# Reentrancy Vulnerability in joinBalancerAndPredeposit and joinBalancerAndPlaza

### Summary

The use of safeIncreaseAllowance before the calls to external contracts will cause a reentrancy vulnerability in the joinBalancerAndPredeposit and joinBalancerAndPlaza if the predeposit or plaza calls have malicious code.

### Root Cause

In BalancerRouter.sol:31 and BalancerRouter.sol:53, the contract uses balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance before the calls to external contracts PreDeposit(_predeposit).deposit and Pool(_plazaPool).create respectively, which can cause a reentrancy.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The _predeposit or _plazaPool points to a malicious contract.

The malicious contract implements the corresponding interfaces.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

A user calls joinBalancerAndPredeposit or joinBalancerAndPlaza with a malicious _predeposit or _plazaPool address.

balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance is called, setting the allowance for the malicious contract.

The malicious contract then calls back into the router contract before the transaction finishes.

This reentrancy can lead to unexpected behaviors, including the approval not being consumed.

### Impact

The reentrancy can lead to unexpected results in the calls to deposit or create, including potentially stolen funds or wrong calculations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a check-effects-interactions pattern, by using safeTransferFrom before the external calls.
