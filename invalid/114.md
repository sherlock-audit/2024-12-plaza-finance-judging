# Lack of Input Validation in getTickAtSqrtRatio

### Summary

The function getTickAtSqrtRatio allows for a sqrtPriceX96 equal to the max price, which goes against the comment.

### Root Cause

In TickMath.sol:141, the function checks if the sqrtPriceX96 is between MIN_SQRT_RATIO and MAX_SQRT_RATIO, but it allows for the sqrtPriceX96 to be equal to MAX_SQRT_RATIO which is against the comment.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The input sqrtPriceX96 is equal to MAX_SQRT_RATIO



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

The function getTickAtSqrtRatio is called with the sqrtPriceX96 equal to MAX_SQRT_RATIO.

The function will not revert and will return a wrong value that can lead to inconsistencies.

### Impact

This can cause inconsistencies in the contract using the library because it allows a value that was not intended.

    contract MaxSqrtRatioTest is Test {

        function testMaxSqrtRatio() public {
            uint160 maxSqrtRatio = TickMath.MAX_SQRT_RATIO;

             int24 tick = TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(maxSqrtRatio);
              assertEq(tick, 887271);
              // this is wrong, because the comment says it should revert,
              // and it should only return the tick less than
              // the price
      }
    }

### Mitigation

The check should revert if the input value is equal to MAX_SQRT_RATIO.
