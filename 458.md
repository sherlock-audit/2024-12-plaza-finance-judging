# Starting a new auction without distributing coupon token of the old one first might make coupon stuck in Pool contract

### Summary

If startAuction() is called before distribute(), reward from the auction of the old period will be stuck in the contract.

### Root Cause

The problem consists of two factors:
1. Distribute() can only retrieve coupon token of the `previousPeriod` (currentPeriod - 1).
2. There is no guarantee that distribute() will always be called before startAuction().

In the case where startAunction() is called before distribute() first, any coupon token that hasn't been distributed  from auctions happening before `currentPeriod - 1` will be stuck in the pool contract.

Consider this scenario:
1. The protocol is in `currentPeriod`.
2. The auction of `previousPeriod` ends and returns coupon token to the pool.
3. startAuction() is being called without distribute() first. The pool now enters period `currentPeriod + 1`. 
4. Calling to distribute() now can only distribute rewards of `currentPeriod`. Reward from `currentPeriod - 1` is stuck in the Pool contract.

### Mitigation

Consider adding mechanism to distribute rewards from auctions in the past periods which are before `previousPeriod`.
