# Potential Token Lock in PreDeposit.sol Due to Late claim() Calls

### Summary

In the PreDeposit.sol contract, the design assumes users will promptly call the claim() function to retrieve their share of bondToken and leverageToken after pool creation. If users delay their claim() until after a new currentPeriod in BondToken.sol, the _update function in BondToken.sol will calculate additional shares for the PreDeposit contract. This causes an issue when interacting with the Distributor contract, as unclaimed couponToken corresponding to the PreDeposit contract’s shares cannot be withdrawn, leaving them permanently locked.

Same will work if bonToken will be used in external pools as Aerodrom. 

### Root Cause

In `PreDeposit.sol`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L178

In `BondToken.sol`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154

	•	The _update function recalculates shares for any address (from or to) during a transfer.
	•	If users delay their claim() call until after a new currentPeriod, the PreDeposit contract’s shares are updated to include unclaimed tokens.

In `Pool.sol`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L549 
	•	The couponAmountToDistribute updated using all token emission.

In `Distributor.sol`:  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L88 
	•	The late claim will lead for user to loss his part of the rewards and PreDeposit doesn't have function to get his part and withdraw it. 


### Internal Pre-conditions

1.	Users delay their claim() call until after a new currentPeriod in BondToken.sol.
2.	The PreDeposit contract accumulates shares due to _update logic during the transfer.

### External Pre-conditions

1.	The protocol distributes couponToken through the Distributor based on the shares recorded in BondToken.sol.

### Attack Path

1.	A user delays their claim() call past the start of a new currentPeriod.
2.	The PreDeposit contract is assigned additional shares during the transfer, representing unclaimed tokens.
3.	The Distributor calculates couponToken distribution based on the inflated shares of the PreDeposit contract.
4.	Since the PreDeposit contract cannot claim these tokens, they remain permanently locked in the Distributor.

### Impact

The protocol encounters locked couponToken in the Distributor, corresponding to the shares of the PreDeposit contract. These locked tokens:
	•	Cannot be withdrawn or utilized.
	•	Result in inefficient fund utilization and reduce the overall distribution to users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a Withdrawal Mechanism for PreDeposit.
