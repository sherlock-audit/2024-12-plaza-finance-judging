# The `endAuction` Function Does Not Exclude Fees When Calculating the Pool's Value, Leaving the beneficiary with less fees

## Finding description
When users deposit reserve tokens (or redeem) to mint their preferred token type, the calculations for `poolReserves` currently exclude accrued fees (e.g., TVL). This is because the subtracted fees belong to the beneficiary and are intended to be claimed separately.

But when the auction ends successfully, the `transferReserveToAuction` function transfers the reserves without accounting for the uncollected fees owed to the beneficiary. This means that the fees that have been accrued but not yet claimed are effectively excluded from the transaction, leading to an inaccurate representation of the available pool reserves. As a result, the beneficiary is deprived from their shares of the fees, which can accumulate significantly over time, especially in scenarios where fees have not been claimed for an extended period.In the end the beneficiary is left with less than what they are entitled to. 


## Proof of Concept
As you can see that when ending an Auction through `endAuction`, The Function calculates the Pool's poolSaleLimit without accounting for fees below
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336C1-L350C4
```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
        state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
@>  } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
        state = State.SUCCEEDED;
        Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
}
```

Keep in mind this is how the fees are calculated
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L719
```solidity
return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
```
This causes the `transferReserveToAuction`, to send out the amount that didnt account for fees.
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L577C1-L583C4
```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Transfers reserve tokens to the current auction.
   * @param amount The amount of reserve tokens to transfer.
   */
  function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```
This means that the beneficiary's fees are mistakenly included in the auction reserves, even though those fees should be separately allocated to the beneficiary. While the auction funds are intended to go to the distributor, the inclusion of the beneficiary's fees in the auctioned amount causes a misallocation of funds. This leads to the unintended issue of the beneficiary’s fees being sold along with the auctioned reserves, resulting in the beneficiary losing out on the fees they have earned.

## Impact
The fee beneficiary will be unable to earn their full calculated fees and will only receive a portion based on the remaining 10% of the pool's reserves (assuming the pool sold 90%, its minimum). If the fees are not collected for an extended period, such as three months, the beneficiary loses out on a significant amount of earned fees. This occurs because the auction calculation includes the entire pool value, which includes unclaimed fees, leaving the beneficiary with only a fraction of what they are entitled to. As a result, unclaimed fees are effectively lost, and the beneficiary receives a diminished payout, impacting their earnings.

## Recommended mitigation steps
When the auction becomes successful, ensure that the fees are excluded from the 90% minimum reserve calculation, as they are separate from the pool’s reserves and should not be considered part of the auctioned amount. Since the pool's value will decrease due to the auction, it is crucial to implement a mechanism that forces the claim of any accrued fees by the beneficiary before the auction succeeds. This ensures that the beneficiary receives their entitled fees as the value of the pool will decrease.
