# Late bidder may gain priority due to blind ranking and reduced `sellCouponAmount`

### Summary

In the auction, if bids are made at the same price (`buyReserveAmount / sellCouponAmount`), the sorting mechanism uses `sellCouponAmount` to determine priority instead of the time of bid placement. This can allow a late bidder to gain priority over an earlier bidder by manipulating the `sellCouponAmount` or benefiting from an adjusted `sellCouponAmount` caused by overflow reductions..

### Root Cause

On the line [Auction.sol#L242](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L242), the order is determined by the size of `sellCouponAmount` if the bid prices are the same.
However, if the new bid occupies the last position in the bid list, the `sellCouponAmount` amount may be reduced by the `removeExcessBids` function, and the comparison should actually be performed by this value.
In short, if a new bid occupies the last position in the bid list, a comparison must be made again to determine whether it is actually a bid with higher priority than the original bid.



### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

Two bidders bid with same coupon/buy amount, and current auction is about to exceed.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

With the same size of `buyReserveAmount` and `sellCouponAmount` values, and even with smaller values, you can push out the last person in the bid list and enter. As a result, the person who bids later wins more than the person who bids first.

### PoC

- Assume `totalBuyCouponAmount = 10e18`, `slotSize = 1e18` and `currentCouponAmount = 9e18`.
- Two bidders submit the same price and `sellCouponAmount`, and these bids are for `lowestBidIndex`:
  - **Bidder 1:** `buyReserveAmount = 2e8`, `sellCouponAmount = 2e18`
  - **Bidder 2:** `buyReserveAmount = 2e8`, `sellCouponAmount = 2e18`
- Total exceeds `totalBuyCouponAmount`, triggering reductions:
  - **Bidder 1:** Reduced to `sellCouponAmount = 1e18`, `buyReserveAmount = 1e8`
  - **Bidder 2:** Bid with `buyReserveAmount` and `sellCouponAmount` of the same size to push out the person who bid first and enter the list. However, after the bid, the size of `buyReserveAmount` and `sellCouponAmount` becomes the same as that of the person who bid first.
- Result: **Bidder 2** will be given priority even though he bid later.

### Mitigation

If a new bid occupies the last position in the bid list, a comparison must be made again with updated `sellCouponAmount` and `buyReserveAmount` to determine whether it is actually a bid with higher priority than the original bid.
