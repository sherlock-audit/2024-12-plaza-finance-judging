# Attacker can manipulate the end state of an auction to be set as `FAILED`

### Summary

When [endAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336-L350) is called and if the state is set to `State.SUCCEEDED` , `transferReserveToAuction()` function call will be made and since it will try to send the `totalSellReserveAmount` tokens to the auction contract it can revert if the pool balance doesn't have the amount needed. Depending of the value of `poolSaleLimit` the attack can be performed more easly or the pool balance of reserveToken can be decreased because of market conditions .

### Root Cause

Every created auction has a `poolSaleLimit` value. The purpose of this value is to set a limit of how much `reserveTokens` can be send from the pool address as an award for the winning bids in case the auction is set to `State.SUCCEEDED`. If `totalSellReserveAmount` exceeds the `poolSaleLimit` the auction state will be set to `Failed` and the winning bidders can call `claimRefund()` . `poolSaleLimit` value can be set from minimum 90% to 100% of the pool reserveToken balance. If the auction active period is being set for example 10 days while the users are bidding , at the same time the pool balance of reserveTokens can change significantly depending of the users activity in the pool, market condition or malicious attacker.
In `Pool.sol` users can call [create()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L192-L194) by specifying what kind of tokens the caller wants `bondToken/leverageToken` and he pays with reserveTokens. This is one of the ways the pool `reserveAmount` to increase. Also there is [redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L353-L355) function with which users can receive `reserveTokens` in exchange of `bondTokens/leverageTokens`, by this decreasing the `reserveToken` amount in pool. An attacker can use this to decrease the pool balance of `reserveTokens` with enough supply (depending of the `poolSaleLimit` value ) or depending of the market conditions and the active users in the pool the decrease of `reserveTokens` amount can be achieved naturally.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

For natural decrease of `reserveTokens` amount 
1. Market price movements and incentives for users to redeem `reserveTokens` in exchange for `bondTokens/leverageTokens` 

For an attacker to manipulate `reserveTokens` amount into the pool
1. As higher as `poolSaleLimit` is the easier for an attacker will be, also in case of a lot of natural demand for reserveToken or sales for reserveToken > buy orders for reserveToken   , less balance he will need to achieve his goal.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The end of an auction can be manipulated by an attacker to be set as `Failed` or naturally fail in case of decrease in `reserveToken` amount in the pool enough that `totalSellReserveAmount > poolSaleLimit`. The incentive of the participants with the winning bids to participate in the auctions again will be lost and the auction functionallity will be bricked since the end state of it can be manipulated.

### PoC

Attack scenario:

1. PoolA has balance of 90 ETH 
2. An auction is created in PoolA for 10 days active period and `poolSaleLimit` set to 95%
3. After the `activePeriod` ends, PoolA has 100ETH and  Alice calls `endAuction()`
4. `totalSellReserveAmount` from the auction is 94 ETH which is < poolSaleLimit (95%) and state of the pool must be set to `SUCCEED`
5. Bob, the attacker,front-runs Alice by scaning the mempool and seeing that Alice has called `endAuction` and that the `transferReserveToAuction()` will attempt to send 94 ETHs to the pool auction
 i - Lets say bondETH is 100 USDC, ETH price is 3000$
 ii -  Bob calls create() in PoolB and swaps 7 ETH for 210 bondTokens ( 7x3000 = 21000$ -> 21000/100USDCperBondToken = 210 bondETH )
 iii -  Bob calls redeem() in PoolA and swaps 210 bondTokens for 7 ETH
6. PoolA `reserveToken` balance is now 93 ETH
7. Alice call will revert because of insuffient balance of `reserveToken` in PoolA
8. Alice tries to call again endAuction() but now `totalSellReserveAmount=94ETH` > `poolSaleLimit = 95% of 93 ETH which is 88 ETH`. State of auction is set to `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`

Natural decrease in the pool

1. Auction in PoolA is started for 10 days with `poolSaleAmount = 95%`  and pool balance of `reserveToken` = 1000ETH
2. Day 7, current value of `totalSellReserveAmount` is 900 ETH
3. Because of market conditions or high activity in the pool , PoolA balance of `reserveTokens` is now 500 ETH
4. Auction active period ends and Alice calls `endAuction()`
5. `totalSellReserveAmount  > poolSaleLimit` , auction state set to `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`

### Mitigation

One way of mitigation this vulnerability can be on creation of the auction the `salePoolLimit` amount from the pool reserveToken balance to be send as winning pot, since `poolSaleLimit` must be atleast 90% and max 100%. By this way in case the `totalBuyCouponAmount` condition is met, the auction will be set to `SUCCEDED`
