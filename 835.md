# Approval overflow causes DoS in `BalancerRouter`'s `exitPlazaAndBalancer`

### Summary

In `_exitBalancerPool`, the `BalancerRouter` contract will invoke `balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance` in order to increase the allowance to the `balancerVault` by the desired `balancerPoolTokenIn`. This is incorrect, given that Balancer Pool Tokens by default have an inifinite allowance to the Balancer vault. This will lead to an overflow always being triggered when trying to approve the vault, effectively Dos’ing `exitPlazaAndBalancer`.

### Root Cause

In `BalancerRouter`'s `_exitBalancerPool` function, the router [tries to approve the BPT tokens to the `balancerVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L140) in order to exit the pool:

```solidity
// File: BalancerRouter.sol

function _exitBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenIn,
        uint256[] memory minAmountsOut,
        bytes memory userData,
        address to
    ) internal {
        IVault.ExitPoolRequest memory request = IVault.ExitPoolRequest({
            assets: assets,
            minAmountsOut: minAmountsOut,
            userData: userData,
            toInternalBalance: false
        });

        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), balancerPoolTokenIn); 
        balancerVault.exitPool(poolId, address(this), payable(to), request);
    }
```

The problem is that BPT tokens **always have an inifinite allowance to the Balancer’s vault in order to save gas and avoid approvals.** This can be seen in [Balancers official `BalancerPoolToken.sol` implementation](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/pool-utils/contracts/BalancerPoolToken.sol#L59-L60), where `allowance` always returns `uint256(-1)` if the `spender` is the vault, and is also mentioned explicitly in natspec: *“Override to grant the Vault infinite allowance, causing for Pool Tokens to not require approval.”*:

```solidity
// File: BalancerPoolToken.sol

/**
     * @dev Override to grant the Vault infinite allowance, causing for Pool Tokens to not require approval.
     *
     * This is sound as the Vault already provides authorization mechanisms when initiation token transfers, which this
     * contract inherits.
     */
function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view override returns (uint256) {
        if (spender == address(getVault())) {
            return uint256(-1);
        } else {
            return super.allowance(owner, spender);
        }
    }
```

When the router tries to approve the vault, it uses `safeIncreaseAllowance` from OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20` library, which is implemented in the following way:

```solidity
// File: SafeERC20.sol

/**
     * @dev Increase the calling contract's allowance toward `spender` by `value`. If `token` returns no value,
     * non-reverting calls are assumed to be successful.
     */
    function safeIncreaseAllowance(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        uint256 oldAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        forceApprove(token, spender, oldAllowance + value);
    }
```

Because `oldAllowance` will be `type(uint256).max` when `spender` is the Balancer vault, the following  `oldAllowance + value` addition will overflow, effectively preventing any withdrawal to be performed via the `BalancerRouter` contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `exitPlazaAndBalancer`
2. The router tries to approve the `balancerVault` as a spender for the `balancerPoolToken`. The `safeIncreaseAllowance` function is called, and an overflow is triggered, DoS’ing any exit via the router.

### Impact

Medium. The `exitPlazaAndBalancer` will **never work.** Because this effectively **breaks core contract functionality and effectively renders the contract useless** (the main purpose of the router is to allow pool deposits/withdrawals and wrap/unwrap BPT tokens while doing it, and it has been demonstrated that withdrawals will never work, a core mechanism of the router), this issue should be deemed medium severity.

### PoC

The following proof of concept illustrates the overflow. To run it, just create a foundry project and paste the following test contract:

```solidity

contract ContractTest is Test {
    string BASE_RPC_URL = vm.envString("BASE_RPC_URL");

    // -- CREATE CONSTANTS HERE --

    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    // -- CREATE STORAGE VARIABLES HERE --

    IERC20 public pool = IERC20(0xC771c1a5905420DAEc317b154EB13e4198BA97D0); // BPT token
    address public vault = 0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8; // Balancer vault

    function setUp() public {
        vm.createSelectFork(BASE_RPC_URL);
    }

    function testBalancer_approvalOverflow() public {
        pool.safeIncreaseAllowance(vault, 1e18); // reverts with arithmetic error
    }

   
}

library SafeERC20 {
    function safeIncreaseAllowance(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        uint256 newAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender) + value;
        // ...
    }
}

interface IERC20 {
    function allowance(address user, address operator) external view returns (uint256);
}

```

Then, create a `.env` with and set `BASE_RPC_URL` to an RPC, and run the poc with `forge test --mt testBalancer_approvalOverflow`. It will revert with “panic: arithmetic underflow or overflow (0x11)” reason.

### Mitigation

Don’t approve the Balancer vault when withdrawing.

```diff
// File: BalancerRouter.sol
function _exitBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenIn,
        uint256[] memory minAmountsOut,
        bytes memory userData,
        address to
    ) internal {
        IVault.ExitPoolRequest memory request = IVault.ExitPoolRequest({
            assets: assets,
            minAmountsOut: minAmountsOut,
            userData: userData,
            toInternalBalance: false
        });

-        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), balancerPoolTokenIn); 
        balancerVault.exitPool(poolId, address(this), payable(to), request);
    }
```
