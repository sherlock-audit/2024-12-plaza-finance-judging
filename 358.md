# If all leverage tokens are redeemed, new ones can't be issued

### Summary

In the current implementation of the `Pool` contract, if all leverage tokens are redeemed, it becomes impossible to issue new leverage tokens. This limitation can lead to the pool operating without one of its primary functionalities, significantly reducing its utility. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L477-L525

### Root Cause

The implementation does not include a mechanism to ensure that a minimum amount of leverage tokens remain in the pool. Without such a safeguard, the complete redemption of leverage tokens effectively halts the issuance of new ones.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The pool contains leverage tokens available for redemption.  
- No mechanism is in place to restrict full redemption of leverage tokens.  

### External Pre-conditions

- A user or entity initiates the redemption of all leverage tokens.

### Impact

If all leverage tokens are redeemed, the pool will no longer support the issuance of new leverage tokens, effectively disabling one of its core functionalities. This can undermine the protocol's operational efficiency and user experience.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

The following test demonstrates the issue. Add this test to `Pool.t.sol`:

```solidity
function testRedeemAllLeverageTokens() public {
    vm.startPrank(governance);
    Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);

    // Mint reserve tokens
    rToken.mint(governance, 10000001000);
    rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 10000000000);

    // Create pool and approve deposit amount
    Pool _pool = Pool(
        poolFactory.createPool(
            params,
            10000000000,
            10000,
            10000,
            "",
            "",
            "",
            "",
            false
        )
    );
    rToken.approve(address(_pool), 10000);

    // Redeem all leverage tokens
    _pool.redeem(Pool.TokenType.LEVERAGE, 10000, 10000);

    // Attempt to create new leverage tokens; it fails
    _pool.create(Pool.TokenType.LEVERAGE, 1000, 0);

    // Reset reserve state
    rToken.burn(governance, rToken.balanceOf(governance));
    rToken.burn(address(_pool), rToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)));
}
```

This test highlights the issue by showing that attempting to create new leverage tokens after redeeming all existing ones results in failure.
