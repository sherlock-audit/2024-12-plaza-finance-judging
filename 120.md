# Wrong fee implementation will incorrectly change token's price

### Summary

In the create function the fee is subtracted from the poolReserves but the user's deposit used to compute the amount of tokens will still include the fee, this will result in user's receiving more shares upon depositing because the fee will constantly decrease the share's price so anytime a user deposits the next user will be able to get more tokens for the same deposit.


### Root Cause

The root cause is that fee will be subtracted from the total reserve amount used to calculate the tvl:

 However the amount that is being deposited will include the fee:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L343
After that the fee will be applied to the new total amount.
As a result the user will not be minted the correct number of tokens because as the fee grows the share price will always decrease. Even with new contributions, they will be charged the same fee as previous ones but since the total amount of fee will increase the share price will be less.
As a result of the wrong fee calculation anytime a user calls `create` the share's price will increase even if there is no change in the market state.


### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.Anytime a new user call create with a pending fee, the user's shares will be increased.

### Impact

The user will get more allocation for the same amount that other users contributed.

### PoC

You can run the following test and get the same output by changing the params.fee = 100000 in `Pool.t.sol`:
```solidity
function testWrongFeeLogic() public {
        vm.startPrank(governance);
        Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);
        rToken.mint(governance, 600e18);
        rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 600e18);
        setEthPrice(3000e8); //set the price to $300
        // Create salt to create the pool at a different address
        string memory salt = "tester";

        // Create pool and approve deposit amount
        Pool _pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(params, 6e18, 140e18, 1e18, "", salt, "", "", false));
        vm.warp(365 days);
        setEthPrice(3000e8);
        address bob = address(0x01);
        rToken.mint(bob, 2e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(bob);

        rToken.approve(address(_pool), 2e18);
        _pool.create(Pool.TokenType.LEVERAGE, 2e18, 0);

        uint256 bobBalanceLeverage = LeverageToken(_pool.lToken()).balanceOf(bob);
        console.log(bobBalanceLeverage);
        address alice = address(0x02);
        rToken.mint(alice, 2e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(alice);

        rToken.approve(address(_pool), 2e18);
        _pool.create(Pool.TokenType.LEVERAGE, 2e18, 0);

        uint256 aliceBalance = LeverageToken(_pool.lToken()).balanceOf(alice);
        console.log(aliceBalance);
    }
```
```bash
[PASS] testWrongFeeLogic() (gas: 2003760)
Logs:
  1851851845564700524
  2251461961214134589
```
As we can see bob got significantly less because the fee decreased the share price, even though bob and alice both deposited in the same market conditions.
