# Bidders may halt bidding by getting themselves blacklisted

### Summary

Auction.sol refunds directly back to the bidder during `_removeBid` and `removeExcessBids`. In tokens that support blacklisting (eg USDC), if the bidder address gets blacklisted, those operations will revert.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L324

When Auction tries to remove the `lowestBidIndex`, it refunds the amount back to the bidder. Such operation will fail if the bidder becomes blacklisted by [interacting with Tornado Cash](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn-judging/issues/147), or having activities with OFAC sanctioned entities. As a result it would be impossible to remove the lowest bid, and to continue bidding.

```solidity
if (bidCount > maxBids) {
  if (lowestBidIndex == newBidIndex) {
    revert BidAmountTooLow();
  }
  _removeBid(lowestBidIndex);
}

...

// Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);

emit BidRemoved(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);
```

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Alice makes a low bid with minimum amount.
2. Alice purposely gets blacklisted by USDC.
3. The protocol's attempts to refund the bid will fail.

### Impact

- Since there is limit on the number of `maxBids`, it won't be possible to remove the lowest bid and create new bids.
- `removeExcessBids` will also fail during the refund step.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use pull instead of push refunds.
