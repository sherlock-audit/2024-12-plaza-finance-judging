# stimulateCreate/stimulateRedeem is using wrong price feed, leading to incorrect calculation of final amounts of plaza tokens

### Summary

There is a mistake when fetching oracle price in stimulateCreate/stimulateRedeem, leading to wrong price feeds being used.

### Root Cause

In stimulateCreate/stimulateRedeem, the function will try to get the price from oracle for underlying asset in USD to calculate final amounts of bond/leverage token. In this case,  underlying asset is base token, and USD is quote token.

getOraclePrice( quote, base) will accept quote address as the first argument and base address as the second one. That means **the correct call** in create/redeem context should be **_getOracle(USD, reserveToken)_**.

However, the code is calling getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD) instead. This will lead to getting the wrong price feed with inverse price
