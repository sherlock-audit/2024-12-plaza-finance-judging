# Missing check for equal length arrays in `joinBalancerPool` and `exitBalancerPool` in the `BalencerRouter` contract

### Summary

The `joinBalancerPool()` and `exitBalancerPool()` functions in `BalancerRouter` do not check whether the lengths of the `assets` and `maxAmountsIn` (or `minAmountsOut`) arrays are equal. This can lead to unintended behavior, such as incorrect asset transfers and potential fund loss.

### Root Cause

In `joinBalancerPool()`, the user submits two arrays: `assets` and `maxAmountsIn`. The function loops through `assets.length`, but does not verify whether `maxAmountsIn` has the same length. If `maxAmountsIn.length > assets.length`, the extra values in `maxAmountsIn` are ignored, leading to incorrect deposit calculations.

Similarly, in `exitBalancerPool()`, the user provides `assets` and `minAmountsOut`, but their lengths are not checked. If `minAmountsOut.length > assets.length`, the extra values in `minAmountsOut` are ignored, potentially leading to incorrect withdrawal calculations.

```solidity
function joinBalancerPool(
    bytes32 poolId,
    IAsset[] memory assets,
    uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
    bytes memory userData
) internal returns (uint256) {
    // Transfer assets from user to this contract
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
        IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
        IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]);
    }
}
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Fund Loss: If `assets.length < maxAmountsIn.length`, the extra values in `maxAmountsIn` remain unvalidated, potentially allowing incorrect deposits.
- Denial of Service (DoS): If the contract expects a certain balance but incorrect amounts are deposited, withdrawals may fail, effectively locking funds.
- Incorrect Pool Accounting: Since Balancer pools rely on precise deposit/withdrawal calculations, ignoring extra values may cause imbalance and miscalculations in liquidity pools.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add checks to ensure that `assets.length` matches `maxAmountsIn.length` in `joinBalancerPool()` and `assets.length` matches `minAmountsOut.length` in `exitBalancerPool()`.

```solidity
require(assets.length == maxAmountsIn.length, "Array length mismatch");
require(assets.length == minAmountsOut.length, "Array length mismatch");
```
