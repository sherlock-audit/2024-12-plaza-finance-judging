# The `MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` is set to 90%, But the Auction is only allowed to use 89% of the Pool

## Finding description
The `MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` is intended to allow the auction to use up to 90% of the pool’s total reserves for sale. However, due to an issue in the current code, the auction is only able to use 89% of the pool reserves instead of the expected 90%.

The auction fails if the sale amount is exactly 90% of the pool balance. This is due to the use of the `>=` operator in the condition that checks the sale limit, which causes the comparison to fail even at the threshold of 90%

## Proof of Concept
The constant variable called `MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` is set to 90, Which The `Pool.sol` uses when starting an Auction.

```solidity
    auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
      address(new Auction()),
      abi.encodeWithSelector(
        Auction.initialize.selector,
        address(couponToken),
        address(reserveToken),
        couponAmountToDistribute,
        block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
        1000,
        address(this),
@>      poolSaleLimit // the initializer sets this value to default == 90 
      )
    );
```
But as soon as the Auction ends through `endAuction` function in `Auction.sol`, the `else if` statements checks if the `totalSellReserveAmount` (The amount users bid for) is bigger or equal to `90%` of the pool, if so revert even though the min is 90%.

```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
@>  } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

## Impact
Let’s say with an example using a pool containing 50 WETH as reserves (approximately $160,000). The current situation prevents the auction from selling the 90% of the pool as intended, capping it at 89% instead 

- Calculation for 89% of the pool: `((50 000 000 000 000 000 000 * 89) / 100) = 44 500 000 000 000 000 000 = 44.5 weth`
- Calculation for 90% of the pool: `((50 000 000 000 000 000 000 * 90) / 100) = 45 000 000 000 000 000 000 = 45 weth`
- The difference is: `45 − 44.5 = 0.5 WETH`

This results in 0.5 WETH (equivalent to approximately $1,600) remaining unsold, even though it falls within the documented 90% limit that users were led to expect. Despite the system's advertised capability to auction up to 90% of the pool, only 89% is actually utilized, leading to the wrong amount that is promised to bidders. This amount can go up depending on the pool's value (e.g $1M).

## Recommended mitigation steps
- Change the sign `>=` to `>` to allow the 90% of the pool to be auctioned
```diff
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
-   } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
+   } else if (totalSellReserveAmount > (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
