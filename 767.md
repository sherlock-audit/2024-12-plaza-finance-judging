# USDC blacklist may be a problem in Auction

### Summary

USDC blacklist may be a problem in `Auction` because of the minimum bid possibility. User is able to make a minimum bid to ensure that his bid will be the lowest one. Doing this in the start of the the auction gives him a good amount of time to get blacklisted by USDC, which means that it is impossible for his bid needs to be compressed or removed by the `Auction` contract, because they transfer the refunded USDC directly to the blacklisted user. This will most likely result in meeting the following criteria for a undersold auction in the [`Auction::endAuction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336-L350) function, which will result in `bondETH` holders being robbed of their USDC:
```solidity
    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
```

This criteria will be met for sure, because the protocol relies on that the bid compression mechanism will make the `currentCouponAmount == totalBuyCouponAmount` and when this doesn't work, the auction is doomed of failure


### Root Cause

The user with the lowest bid getting blacklisted. This can happen not only unintentionally but as attack, since he can purposefully make the smallest bid possible to be last in line and the perform malicious activities to blacklisted from USDC

### Internal Pre-conditions

a user securing lowest bid in the auction by making a minimum bid first 

### External Pre-conditions

User being blacklisted by USDC during the auction period

### Attack Path

1. User makes the minimum bid first which secures that the last bid will always be his
2. Then by one reason or another (by accident or not) he gets blacklisted by USDC which prevents the auction from being ended correctly 

### Impact

The other bidders can't get the ETH related tokens they bidded for and the `bondETH` holders are practically robbed from their interest for one or possibly more auctions if this happen again

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Transfer the USDC to some kind of escrow from where the owners of the removed/compressed bids can withdraw their money
