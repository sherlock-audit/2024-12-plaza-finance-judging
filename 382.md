# Sandwich the startAuction function with flashloan

### Summary

Attacker able to front run the start auction function with flash loan in order to get the more shares of couponToken. Here Attacker front run startAuction calling , get the flash loan then call [create](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L192) minting bond token to himself. (Here attacker share amount is [calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L194C5-L196C6) up to current period -1 ). Then  [startAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530) is invoked. There its increased the `currentPeriod` by one [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L567C15-L567C41). Then he [redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L353) his flash loan amount . There minting bond token amount is burned and he get back his collateral amount(reserveToken). During the burning [process](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L403), its invoked [_update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154) , there `updateIndexedUserAssets` is called , in `updateIndexedUserAssets` function [shares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L195C18-L195C26) amount calculate with large number of bond token balances minting with flash loan.(Since [period](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L194C54-L194C60) is increased by one with `startAuction` function)   

### Root Cause

Attacker front run the start auction function with flash loan. Initially he mint the large amount of `reserveToken` with flash loan then call `create`. 

```solidity
  function create(TokenType tokenType, uint256 depositAmount, uint256 minAmount) external whenNotPaused() nonReentrant() returns(uint256) {
    return _create(tokenType, depositAmount, minAmount, address(0));
  }
```
startAuction is invoked.

```solidity
function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
```

currentPeriod is increased by one in startAuction function.

```solidity
bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);
```
Call redeem function to get back his `reserveToken` amount to pay back flash loan. 

```solidity
  function redeem(TokenType tokenType, uint256 depositAmount, uint256 minAmount) public whenNotPaused() nonReentrant() returns(uint256) {
    return _redeem(tokenType, depositAmount, minAmount, address(0));
  }
```
During burning bond token its updated the attacker shares amount with current amount of bond token. 

```solidity
bondToken.burn(msg.sender, depositAmount);
```
Here its invoked [_update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L156) , there `updateIndexedUserAssets` called . Eventually its invoked `getIndexedUserAmount` function

```solidity
  function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }

```
Here attacker shares amount is calculated based on the current balance amount. Here balance amount is large amount due to bond minted with flash loan. So with the flash loan attacker able to get the more shares. 





### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker front run the start auction function with flash loan. Initially he mint large amount of `reserveToken` then call `create`.
2. Invoked `startAuction` function.
3. Invoked `redeem` function to get back his collateral to back & pay flash loan.

### Impact

The attacker acquires an exorbitant amount of shares, causing depositors to lose the shares they rightfully own.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a constraint that prevents users from executing `create` and `redeem`  within the same transaction. This can be enforced by either introducing a mandatory waiting period before redeeming or requiring the `redeem` to occur at least one block after the `create` .
