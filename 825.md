# Backrunning `claimFees()` unfairly gives better rates

### Summary

The `simulateCreate()` function calculates fees based on the time elapsed since `lastFeeClaimTime` using `block.timestamp`. However, when `claimFees()` is executed, a backrunner calling `create()` in the same block will have `block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime = 0`, resulting in no fee deduction from `poolReserves`. This implementation flaw means backrunners can mint tokens using the full post-fee reserves while regular users have their reserves reduced by the fee calculation, creating an exploitable MEV opportunity that undermines fair token creation pricing.

### Root Cause

See the fee deduction in `simulateCreate()`:
```solidity
    // Calculate and subtract fees from poolReserves
    poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
```

`lastFeeClaimTime` is set to `block.timestamp` in `claimFees()` which would create an unfair advantage for a backrunning user:
```solidity
  function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
    require(msg.sender == feeBeneficiary || poolFactory.hasRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE(), msg.sender), NotBeneficiary());
    uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();
    
    if (feeAmount == 0) {
      revert NoFeesToClaim();
    }
    
    lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
    
    emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
  }
```

### Impact

The fee calculation mechanism in `simulateCreate()` enables MEV opportunities through backrunning. When `claimFees()` is called, a backrunner can execute `create()` in the same block to obtain better token minting rates since `block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime = 0`, effectively avoiding the fee deduction that regular users face. This creates an unfair advantage where sophisticated users can consistently get better rates by monitoring and backrunning fee claim transactions.

In the worst case scenario if no one calls `create()` for a long time the `lastFeeClaimTime` will be time of pool creation and the fee may be high enough that no user wants to call `create()` first.

### Mitigation

To prevent fee calculation manipulation from backrunning `claimFees()`, modify the fee calculation to use a block-based fee snapshot system where each block's fee rate is determined at the start of the block and cached. This ensures all transactions within the same block use identical fee calculations regardless of execution order.
