# BondETH Cannot Be Sold When Needed


### Summary
When the TVL is low, BondETH cannot be sold safely.

### Root Cause
An underflow error occurs in Pool.sol#L498 when `tvl` is less than `bondToSell * 100`.

    function getRedeemAmount(

        // Calculate the collateral level based on the token type
        uint256 collateralLevel;
        if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND) {
498:        collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
        } else {
        ...

        }

```
Assming: `poolReserve = 10 ETH`, `ethPrice = $1000`, `bondSupply = 2000 bondEth`, `oracleDecimals = 18`
When a user attempts to sell 120 bondETH:
In L91, `tvl = (1000e18 * 10e18) / 1e18 = 10,000e18`, 
In L498, `(tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) = 10,000e18 - (120e18 * 100) = -2,000e18 < 0`
As a result, this user's transaction is reverted. 
At this point, users must divide their bondETH for sale. However, if the ether price continues to fall, users will need to divide their bondETH into many smaller transactions (e.g.,ten thousands or more). And this transaction can't successed due to the gas consumstion.

In sherlock rule:
>The issue causes funds to be locked for more than a week.
>The issue impacts the availability of time-sensitive functions (cutoff functions are not considered time-sensitive).
>If at least one of these is describing the case, the issue can be Medium.

The `redeem()` function is time-sensitive function, because the price used in this fucntion is value that keep changing.

### Impact
Users are dosed.

### Mitigation
Consider using `int256` to improve handling of negative values.
