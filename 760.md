# Auctions can never be completed

### Summary

when Auction::endAuction is called, if the auction is successful , it calls Pool::transferReserveToAuction 
where this [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L578-L580)  occurs 

the auction for the current period is always address zero 
every time an auction is created for period for period x, the current period is immediately updated to x + 1 
so there is no auction set in state for x + 1 

### Root Cause

wrong check in transferReserveToAuction

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

all auctions will fail and users will never be able to claim coupon tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

the check should be rewritten
`  (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod - 1];
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());`
