# The fee beneficiary will claim less fees than the intended fees for him

# Summary

The fees that the beneficiary should take are maximum 10% of the pool, but the beneficiary will get less than the intented, because the calculation of the fees is based on the current pool balance not of the received reserveTokens.

# Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the [`Pool::getFeeAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L718-L720) function that calculates the fees based on the current pool balance not on the received reserveTokens.
The problem arises when the beneficiary claims the fees after the auction ends. Because the `Pool` contract will transfer 90% of the reserve tokens to the `Auction` contract and the calculation of the fees will be based on the current pool balance that will be maximum 10% from the reserve tokens. This means that the beneficiary will not get 10% from the whole pool amount, but from the rest 10% of it.

# Impact

The beneficiary will receive less fees than intended.

# PoC

The function `Pool::claimFees` allows the beneficiary address to claim his accumulated fees:

```solidity

function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
    require(msg.sender == feeBeneficiary || poolFactory.hasRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE(), msg.sender), NotBeneficiary());
    uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();
    
    if (feeAmount == 0) {
      revert NoFeesToClaim();
    }
    
    lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
    
    emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
  }

function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
}

```

The `claimFees` uses the `getFeeAmount` function to calculate the amount of the fee. In the calculation it is used the current balance of the pool contract. The problem here is that there is no specified time when this function can be called. 

If the function is called before the end of the auction, then the beneficiary's fee will be calculated based on the current pool's balance. At that time the pool's balance should contain the `reserveToken` that should be later transfered to the `Auction` contract. And all will be correct, because the beneficiary will get max 10% from the pool and the other will be for the auction.
Here is the `Auction::endAuction` function that ensures that the `totalSellReserveAmount` is not more than the 90% from the pool balance and transfers the required amount from the `Pool` contract to the `Auction` contract:

```solidity

function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
}

```

And here is the `Pool::transferReserveToAuction` function that transfers reserve tokens to the current auction:

```solidity

function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}

```

The problem arises when the beneficiary claims the fees after the auction ends. Because the `Pool` contract will transfer maximum of the 90% of the reserve tokens to the `Auction` contract and the calculation of the fees will be based on the current pool balance that will be maximum 10% from the reserve tokens. This means that the beneficiary will get not 10% from the whole pool amount, but from the rest 10% from it.

# Mitigation

Calculate the fees amount based on the received reserveTokens not on the pool balance.
