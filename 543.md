# Malicious Actors Can Exploit Missing Slippage Protection on Balance LP Token in `joinBalancerPool` and `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` Function to Cause Financial Losses to Users

### Summary

The `joinBalancerPool` function called by the `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` in `BalancerRouter.sol` lacks adequate slippage protection for the amount of LP tokens received during interactions with Balancer Vault. The lack of slippage protection during joinBalancerPool operations contrasts with the exitPlazaAndBalancer function, which includes slippage checks of minbalancerPoolTokenOut, leading to an incomplete and inconsistent security framework. This oversight exposes users to potential losses due to MEV (Miner Extractable Value) attacks, front-running, or other price manipulation tactics. 

### Root Cause

**Incomplete Implementation of Slippage Protection:** While the function includes a `maxAmountsIn` parameter to cap input amounts, it does not have a `minLPTokensOut` parameter to ensure users receive a minimum amount of LP tokens for their inputs. This creates a security gap during interactions with Balancer Vault.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `joinBalancerPool` function transfers user tokens to the contract and authorizes the Balancer Vault to use them.
2. The function calls `joinPoolRequest` to deposit tokens into the pool and receive LP tokens in return.
3. The function calculates the number of LP tokens received:

```solidity
   return balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter - balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore;
```
4. No validation exists to ensure the LP tokens received meet a minimum threshold.

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker can manipulate the pool state (e.g., via front-running or sandwich attacks).
2. The system interacts directly with the Balancer Vault, where LP token amounts are determined dynamically based on pool conditions.
3. A lack of slippage protection in the contract allows users to receive significantly fewer LP tokens than expected during unfavorable conditions.

### Attack Path

1. **Setup:** The user calls the `joinBalancerAndPredeposit`, which invokes `joinBalancerPool`.
2. **Attack Execution:** An attacker observes the transaction in the mempool and front-runs it by manipulating the pool's state (e.g., depositing or withdrawing large amounts to skew the pool ratio).
3. **Result:** The manipulated pool state causes the user to receive significantly fewer LP tokens than expected, while the attacker reaps a profit.
4. **Impact:** The user loses value due to the discrepancy between input tokens and LP tokens received, with no recourse for recovery.

### Impact

1. **User Loss:** Users may deposit large amounts of tokens but receive far fewer LP tokens than expected.
2. **Increased Risk of Exploitation:** MEV bots and malicious actors can exploit this lack of slippage protection through price manipulation.
3. **Inconsistent Security Measures:** The lack of slippage protection during `joinBalancerPool` operations contrasts with the `exitPlazaAndBalancer` function, which includes slippage checks of `minbalancerPoolTokenOut`, leading to an incomplete and inconsistent security framework.

### PoC

**Vulnerable Code Example:**
[plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol:joinBalancerPool#L84-L89](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L84C1-L89C79)
```solidity
function joinBalancerPool(
    bytes32 poolId,
    IAsset[] memory assets,
    uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
    bytes memory userData
) internal returns (uint256) {
    balancerVault.joinPool(poolId, address(this), address(this), request);
    return balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter - balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore;
}
```

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Deploy the contract and initialize it with Balancer Vault.
2. Call `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` with valid inputs.
3. Use an MEV bot or other tools to manipulate the poolâ€™s state immediately before the transaction.
4. Observe that the user receives far fewer LP tokens than expected without any validation to prevent this.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to add minimum LP tokens out parameter and update the `joinBalancerPool` function to include a `minLPTokensOut` parameter and enforce slippage protection:
```solidity
   function joinBalancerPool(
       bytes32 poolId,
       IAsset[] memory assets,
       uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
       uint256 minLPTokensOut,
       bytes memory userData
   ) internal returns (uint256) {
       uint256 balancerPoolTokenBefore = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));
       balancerVault.joinPool(poolId, address(this), address(this), request);
       uint256 balancerPoolTokenAfter = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));
       
+       uint256 lpTokensReceived = balancerPoolTokenAfter - balancerPoolTokenBefore;
+       require(lpTokensReceived >= minLPTokensOut, "Slippage too high");
+       return lpTokensReceived;
   }
```
