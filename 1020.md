# usdc blacklisted bidder can brick the whole auction

### Summary

A blacklisted USDC address can permanently disable the auction mechanism by preventing the removal of excess bids, blocking new bids from being placed.
The auction mechanism relies on USDC transfers for refunding excess bids. If a bidder becomes USDC blacklisted, these transfers will fail, causing the entire auction to become inoperable.
The auction system's reliance on direct USDC transfers for excess bid refunds creates a critical vulnerability where a blacklisted USDC address can cause a revert when trying to refund a bidder



    address bidder = bidToRemove.bidder;
    uint256 buyReserveAmount = bidToRemove.buyReserveAmount;
    uint256 sellCouponAmount = bidToRemove.sellCouponAmount;
    currentCouponAmount -= sellCouponAmount;
    totalSellReserveAmount -= buyReserveAmount;


    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);


    emit BidRemoved(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);


    delete bids[bidIndex];
    bidCount--;


/


        uint256 reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18);
        currentBid.buyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount - reserveReduction;
        totalSellReserveAmount -= reserveReduction;
        
        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
        
        amountToRemove = 0;
        emit BidReduced(currentIndex, currentBid.bidder, currentBid.buyReserveAmount, currentBid.sellCouponAmount);
      }





### Root Cause

The bid removal process is directly coupled with token transfers
Every new bid must successfully execute all refunds to proceed

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.attacker Place bids that will become lowest when higher bids come in
2.Get blacklisted after bid placement

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.Attacker places minimum valid bid
2.bid becomes lowest when higher bids arrive
3.Gets address blacklisted
4.Bid removal becomes impossible

Auction Manipulation:

Higher bids trigger excess removal
Blacklisted address prevents refunds
New bids cannot be processed
Auction permanently locked


### Impact

Unable to process new bids
Locked funds for legitimate participants
not that this attack can happen unintentionally too if a bidder gets blacklisted considering this scenario this should be a high

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Separate bid removal from refund mechanism
