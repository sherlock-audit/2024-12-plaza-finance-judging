# Premature Auction Termination Leading to Fund Locking

## Summary

The **Premature Auction Termination Leading to Fund Locking** vulnerability exists within the `Auction.sol` contract of the Plaza Protocol. This vulnerability allows any participant to prematurely end an auction in a `FAILED_UNDERSOLD` state before the `totalBuyCouponAmount` is met. Consequently, this action enables the malicious actor to reclaim their bid without affecting the auction outcome adversely, while other legitimate bidders are left unable to finalize their participation, effectively locking their funds.

### Impact Overview

- **Fund Locking for Legitimate Bidders:** Honest participants who place valid bids intending to acquire coupons cannot finalize their bids if an attacker terminates the auction early. Their invested `sellCouponAmount` becomes irretrievable as the auction transitions to a failed state.
  
- **Attacker Advantage:** The attacker gains the ability to disrupt the auction process without incurring any financial loss. By forcing the auction into a `FAILED_UNDERSOLD` state, the attacker ensures their funds are refundable while leaving other bidders at a loss.

### Risk Justification

This vulnerability introduces a high-level risk due to the potential for significant financial loss to legitimate users and the ease with which an attacker can exploit this flaw without detection or repercussion. The flaw undermines the core functionality and trust in the auction mechanism, which is fundamental to the Plaza Protocol's operations.

## Vulnerability Details


### Relevant Code Snippets


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336-L365

### Detailed Explanation

The vulnerability arises from the `endAuction()` function, which can be invoked by any participant once the auction's end time has been reached. The function evaluates whether the `currentCouponAmount` meets the `totalBuyCouponAmount`. If not, it transitions the auction state to `FAILED_UNDERSOLD`. Importantly, this state change allows the caller to reclaim their `sellCouponAmount` via the `claimRefund()` function. However, it inadvertently prevents other legitimate bidders from claiming their intended `buyReserveAmount`, effectively locking their funds.

#### How It Works:

1. **Bid Placement:**
   - Bidders place their bids by specifying `buyReserveAmount` and `sellCouponAmount`.
   - These bids are stored and managed within a sorted linked list based on bid competitiveness.

2. **Auction Termination:**
   - Once the auction's `endTime` is surpassed, any participant can invoke `endAuction()`.
   - If `currentCouponAmount` is less than `totalBuyCouponAmount`, the auction state changes to `FAILED_UNDERSOLD`.

3. **Refund Mechanism:**
   - The attacker, having placed a bid, can call `claimRefund()` to retrieve their `sellCouponAmount`.
   - Legitimate bidders are left unable to claim their `buyReserveAmount` as the auction is marked as failed.

#### Proof-of-Concept Code and Results

- The attacker successfully placed a bid and, after the auction end time, invoked `endAuction()`.
- The auction state transitioned to `FAILED_UNDERSOLD`.
- The attacker was able to reclaim their `sellCouponAmount` via `claimRefund()`.
- The honest bidder's funds remained locked, preventing them from claiming their intended `buyReserveAmount`.


## Impact Section

The **Premature Auction Termination** vulnerability has several critical impacts on the Plaza Protocol:

1. **Financial Loss for Legitimate Bidders:**
   - Honest users who place bids intending to purchase coupons are unable to finalize their bids, resulting in their `sellCouponAmount` being irretrievable.
   - This loss undermines user trust and can lead to a decline in platform participation.

2. **Exploitation by Malicious Actors:**
   - Attackers can disrupt auction processes without any financial risk, gaining an unfair advantage and potentially manipulating future auction outcomes.
   - This behavior can deter new users and investors from engaging with the Plaza Protocol.


## Tools Used

**Tools Used:** Manual Review and Foundry.

## Recommendation

**Restrict Access to `endAuction()`:**
   - **Implementation:** Modify the `endAuction()` function to include access control, allowing only the Pool contract or a designated authorized role to invoke it.
   - **Benefit:** Prevents unauthorized participants from prematurely terminating the auction, ensuring only trusted entities can finalize auction states.
