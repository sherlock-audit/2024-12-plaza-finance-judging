# Reentrancy Attack via Insecure State Update Ordering in Excess Bid Removal

### Summary

This vulnerability arises from the insecure ordering of state updates and fund transfers in the `Auction.sol::removeExcessBids` function. Specifically, the function does not update the `amountToRemove` before transferring funds to the bidder, allowing an attacker to exploit this timing gap. By triggering reentrancy, the attacker could repeatedly manipulate the state and withdraw more funds than intended, leading to potential loss or corruption of reserves.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Initial Call to `removeExcessBids:` An attacker triggers the `removeExcessBids()` function to remove excess bids when the `currentCouponAmount` exceeds the `totalBuyCouponAmount`. This call initiates the process of reducing the amount in excess and transferring it back to the bidders.

### Impact

Excessive Fund Drain: The attacker can repeatedly withdraw funds more than the intended amount, draining the protocol's reserves. Since the `amountToRemove` is not updated before transferring funds, the attacker can recursively call the function and bypass the intended limits, causing an overflow in withdrawals.

### Mitigation

            ```solidity

                    // First, update the state 
                    amountToRemove = 0;
        
                    // Then, refund the proportional sellAmount
                    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);

             ```
