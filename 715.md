# WSTETH is not supported by the protocol

### Summary

WSTETH is not supported by the protocol. This is due to the absence of WSTETH/USD price feed, which will result in impossibility to fetch its price properly. The only relevant existing price feed for WSTETH is [WSTETH/ETH](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=base&page=1&search=wstETH), which should be used if the protocol wants to support this token. 



### Root Cause

Absence of WSTETH/USD price feed on Base chain

### Internal Pre-conditions

calling the [`Pool::create`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L192) or [`Pool::redeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance
/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L366) function to expose this vulnerability 

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

WSTETH is not supported by the protocol, which is direct contradiction with the README

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Make an adapter for WSTETH, which requires 2 feeds. One for WSTETH/ETH ration and one for the ETH/USD ratio
