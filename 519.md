# `Auction::bid` can be reverted because of blocked addresses

### Summary

`Auction::bid` can be reverted because of blocked addresses

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L286

### Internal pre-conditions

USDC is coupon token

### PoC

### Auction State Transition and Bid Handling

The auction's state transitions to **`SUCCEEDED`** when the following conditions are met:

1. **Coupon Conditions**: 
   - `currentCouponAmount` equals `totalBuyCouponAmount`.

2. **Reserve Condition**: 
   - `totalSellReserveAmount` is less than 90%[sale_limit and that is configurable] of the pool's reserve.

#### Handling Excess Bids
- If a new bid exceeds `totalBuyCouponAmount`:
  - The excess bid amount is deducted from the lowest bid.
  - The remaining excess is sent back to the owner of the lowest bid.

#### Important Note: Address Blocking
- addresses may be blocked in USDC.
- If the bidder's address is blocked:
  - Any new bid that causes the `currentCouponAmount` to exceed `totalBuyCouponAmount` will be reverted.
      

### Impact

`Auction::removeExcessBids` will be reverted

### Mitigation

Consider to don't send directly coupon token[USDC] to users and let users claim them
