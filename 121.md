# Users unable to claim coupon amount owed because of the use of USDC

### Summary

The use of USDC as the coupon token used for paying coupon payments to bond holders brings the risk of users not being able to receive rewards owed to them because of `blacklisting`.

### Root Cause

USDC has functionality that ensure only transfers can happen from and to addresses that are not on the `blacklist`. If an address is blacklisted, they will not be able to engage in transfers of USDC. 

In the case of this protocol, that means that any blacklisted addresses will never be able to receive coupon payments for their bonds. 


### Impact

Even if a user has purchased a significant amount of bonds from the protocol and is owed significant amounts of coupon payments (lets assume they held for 8 periods / 2 years) without claiming their rewards - they have a significant amount of coupon payments to collect (especially if they have a lot of bond tokens). 

After the 8 periods, they decide to claim their rewards -> the transfer of USDC to them will fail because they are on a blacklist - and they will not receive their coupon payments.

The protocol has functionality that allows users to transfer their bond tokens and still receive the payments owed to them for the previous periods that they held. So it seems they would be able to get around this blacklist by transferring the bond tokens to a different address they own and then claim rewards. But that is not true, the transfer will give their new address (not blacklisted) an updated coupon period and store the amount of unpaid periods the blacklisted address held before the transfer. 

So, at the time of claim, the old address (blacklisted) - will have to call `claim` -> and `claim` uses msg.sender to check the history of periods they held to determine the coupons owed to them and then transfers to msg.sender. Because of this, they will never be able to receive coupon payments for the periods they held and will only receive payments for the current period and going forward.

### Mitigation

There are no warnings or documentation that discusses the potential risks that users could face as a result of the coupon payment being made in USDC. This is a user facing problem, but it is the design choice of the protocol to issue coupon payments in USDC and users should be made aware of the risks associated.
