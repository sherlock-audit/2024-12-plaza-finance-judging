# malicious users can DOS the auction functionality

### Summary

Auction:endAuction function will check wheather auction was succedded or not by this check,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341-L342
```solidity
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
```
here a malicious user can bid amount such that this check will fail, may just a few minutes before endAuction was called as it is a periodically called function.
so the auction fails and now the malicious user can take back his bid amount by this function,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L367-L376
```solidity
  function claimRefund(uint256 bidIndex) auctionExpired auctionFailed whenNotPaused external {
    Bid storage bidInfo = bids[bidIndex];
    if (bidInfo.bidder != msg.sender) revert NothingToClaim();
    if (bidInfo.claimed) revert AlreadyClaimed();


    bidInfo.claimed = true;
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.sellCouponAmount);


    emit BidRefundClaimed(bidIndex, bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.sellCouponAmount);
  }
```
so by this way malicious users can DOS the auction functionality without any funds loss to them, it will only cost them some transaction cost that's it.
If malicious users can keep on repeating this in every auction then protocol will not work as intended.


### Root Cause

malicious users can cause this check to fail with temporary transfer of coupon tokens to auction contract such that totalsellreserveAmount will exceeded poolsaleLimit
```solidity
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

malicious user will call bid function with such amount such that totalsellreserveAmount will execeeds poolsaleLimit just before auction gets ends and then get back there bid amount using claimRefund function.
by this way malicious users can DOS auction functionality by repeating this when ever a auction takes place.so that protocol will not work as intended.(protocok can't provide  incentive for holding bondeth tokens).

### Impact

Auction functionality can be DOSed so that protocol will not work as intended( protocol can't provide coupon tokens as incentive to users who hold bondeth tokens).
