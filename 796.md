# Price feed logic is incorrect and prevents integrating certain reserve assets

### Summary

The protocol always assumes that `reserveAsset`'s value is equal to ETH’s value, or has not considered some feeds are unavailable at Base via Chainlink. This is an incorrect assumption that will lead to loss of funds, given that the main protocol computations will be incorrect.

### Root Cause

When [the oracle price is fetched](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/ab5bbd7d54042e4444b711a32def5b639fbd63b4/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L446), the `reserveToken` and USD are passed as parameters to the `getOraclePrice` function. `getOraclePrice` is a function from the `OracleReader` contract, which will interact with the `OracleFeeds` contract in order to fetch the correct feed for the given assets:

```solidity
// File: Pool.sol

function simulateCreate(
        TokenType tokenType,
        uint256 depositAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        ...

        return
            getCreateAmount(
                tokenType,
                depositAmount,
                bondSupply,
                levSupply,
                poolReserves,
                getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD), <@
                getOracleDecimals(reserveToken, USD)
            ).normalizeAmount(COMMON_DECIMALS, assetDecimals);
    }
```

```solidity
// File: OracleReader.sol

function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns(uint256) {
    bool isInverted = false;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(quote, base);
     
    ...
  }
```

The `OracleFeeds` contract simply acts as a database of price feed addresses for a pair of assets:

```solidity
// File: OracleFeeds.sol

contract OracleFeeds is AccessControl {

  ...

  // Mapping of token pairs to their price feed addresses
  mapping(address => mapping(address => address)) public priceFeeds;
  ...
  function setPriceFeed(address tokenA, address tokenB, address priceFeed, uint256 heartbeat) external onlyRole(GOV_ROLE) {
    priceFeeds[tokenA][tokenB] = priceFeed;

    if (heartbeat == 0) {
      heartbeat = 1 days;
    }
 
    feedHeartbeats[priceFeed] = heartbeat;
  }
```

This means that Plaza will always try to fetch a direct `reserveAsset`/USD price, which is problematic for two reasons:

- Some price feeds in base don’t have a direct feed for USD. For example, wstETH (which is an in-scope token as per the protocol’s README), [does not have a direct wstETH-USD](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=base&page=1&search=wst#base-mainnet) feed.
- Even if these assets had a direct feed for USD, it still would imply that Plaza assumes some LST/LRT’s are pegged 1:1 to ETH, given that as shown in the code snippets, the feed requested is directly `reserveAsset`/USD.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The Plaza team wants to deploy a pool with wstETH as reserve asset. Because there’s no direct wstETH/USD feed in Chainlink, two possible outcomes occur:

- The Plaza team is unable to deploy the protocol, effectively causing a DoS and preventing the protocol from working as expected.
- The Plaza team decides to pick the regular ETH/USD feed, assuming 1 wstETH == 1 ETH. This assumption is incorrect, given that wstETH is the wrapped version of stETH (a rebasing token), so wstETH accrues in value (the wstETH/ETH rate can be seen [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth/eth).

### Impact

This issue has two different impacts, depending on the decision taken by the Plaza team:

- If the Plaza team decides to deploy with a different oracle (for example, the ETH/USD oracle for wstETH as a reserve asset), this will lead to a loss of funds in the protocol, given that wstETH would be **undervalued**, causing the TVL and collateralization level computations to be wrong, and breaking the amount of bondETH/levETH to mint/redeem.
- Otherwise, the Plaza team can’t deploy the protocol, and it effectively causes a Denial of Service, given that the expected functionality won’t work. The protocol would need changes and additional audits.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a multi-step oracle to convert between requested assets. For example, if `reserveAsset` is wstETH, the conversions should be wstETH → ETH → USD. This can be implemented in the `OracleFeeds` contract, by implementing the multi-step conversion if `tokenA` is not ETH/WETH.
