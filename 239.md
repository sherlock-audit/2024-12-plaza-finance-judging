# Tokens are not refunded when using BalancerRouter.

## Bug description
`BalancerRouter` servers as the intermediary allowing users to seamlessly deposit BPT tokens into Plaza without a need for interacting with the Balancer directly. This can be done by calling `joinBalancerAndPlaza()` function, which will call `joinBalancerPool()` function to mint BPT tokens.

[BalancerRouter.sol#L65-L75](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L65-L75)
```solidity
function joinBalancerPool(
    bytes32 poolId,
    IAsset[] memory assets,
    uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
    bytes memory userData
) internal returns (uint256) {
    // Transfer assets from user to this contract
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
        IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            maxAmountsIn[i]
        );
        IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(
            address(balancerVault),
            maxAmountsIn[i]
        );
    }
```

The function transfers the `maxAmountIn` tokens from users, which is the maximum amount of tokens user is willing to deposit to get the amount of BPT specified in `userData`. However, the problem is that the function does not refund any unused amount of tokens as the Balancer might not use up to `maxAmountIn` tokens during a deposit. Any unused amount is not refunded and will be locked in the `BalancerRouter` contract without a way to sweep it.

## Root cause
Not refunding the unused tokens when depositing to Balancer.

## Attack path
User specifies `maxAmount` in as 10 tokens wanting to receive 10 `BPT` tokens in returns. However Balancer only uses 9 of user's deposit tokens and the rest is not refunded back to the user, but left in the contract without a way to sweep it.

## Impact
Loss of funds for a user.
## Recommended Mitigation
Refund any unused amount during deposit.
