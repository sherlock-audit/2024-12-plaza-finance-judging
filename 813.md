# The false assumption that 1USDC equals 1USD may result in losses to the user or the protocol

### Summary

The system uses the chainlink Oracle, which returns USD values ​​on the Base network, and additionally the TWAP system from Aerodrome, which will return the value in stablecoin, in this case USDC. Additionally, there is an assumption that the bondToken price will be set to 100, without a clear indication of the unit. Based on the documentation, it will be USDC, and based on information from the team, it will be a value dependent on the oracle used, i.e. USD. Following the entire process of exchanging `reserveToken` for `bondToken` and vice versa, it turns out that regardless of the selected unit, if the price of 1USDC is not equal to 1USD, then either the user or the protocol will suffer a loss.

### Root Cause

The reason for the error is the lack of conversion of USDC to USD value.

Let's first analyze the function `create`, which is used to mint `bontToken` tokens in exchange for `reserveToken`.
The heart of the function is the function `getCreateAmount`, which is responsible for calculating the number of bondTokens.

`create -> _create -> simulateCreate -> getCreateAmount`

[Pool.getCreateAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L306-L306)

File: plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol
  306:   function getCreateAmount(
  ...
  324: 
  325:     uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);//18 USD
  326:     uint256 collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);//100_00
  327:     uint256 creationRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;//8 100_000_000 //usdc //audit:info: to be ok, BOND_TARGET_PRICE must be USD
  328: 
  329:     if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) { // <= 120_0000 // 120%
  330:       if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
  331:         revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
  332:       }
  333:       creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;//800_000 //audit:info: if tvl is in USD, ratio is USD
  334:     } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
  335:       if (assetSupply == 0) {
  336:         revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
  337:       }
  338: 
  339:       uint256 adjustedValue = tvl - (BOND_TARGET_PRICE * bondSupply);
  340:       creationRate = (adjustedValue * PRECISION) / assetSupply;
  341:     }
  342:     
  343:     return ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals); //audit:info: everything is in USD if BOND_TARGET_PRICE is in USD
  344:   }

```

If the value of `BOND_TARGET_PRICE` is set in USDC, then the calculated `creationRate` calculated for `collateralLevel > 1.2`, i.e. `BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION` should be converted by the USDC/USD rate.

Depending on the deviation of USDC from the USD price (we know from history deviations greater than 0.01%), the calculated number will be:
- in the case of a rate above 1USD - in theory a loss for the user, but he agrees to some minimum amount received in the exchange, so theoretically ok,
- in the case of a rate below 1USD - the protocol will be a loss, because the user will get more than he should.

The above case will not occur if the value of BOND_TARGET_PRICE is in USD, however, then it causes an error in the calculations for the `redeem` function, which I will analyze below.

The heart of the `redeem` function, which is used to exchange a `bondToken` for a `reserveToken`, is `getRedeemAmount`.

`redeem -> _redeem -> simulateRedeem -> getRedeemAmount`

[Pool.getRedeemAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L477-L477)

```solidity
File: plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol
  477:   function getRedeemAmount(
  478:     TokenType tokenType,
  479:     uint256 depositAmount, //bondToken
  480:     uint256 bondSupply,
  481:     uint256 levSupply,
  482:     uint256 poolReserves, //WETH

  485:     uint256 marketRate //USDC
  486:   ) public pure returns(uint256) {
  487:     if (bondSupply == 0) {
  488:       revert ZeroDebtSupply();
  489:     }
  490: 
  491:     uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals); //USD
  492:     uint256 assetSupply = bondSupply;
  493:     uint256 multiplier = POINT_EIGHT;
  494: 
  495:     // Calculate the collateral level based on the token type
  496:     uint256 collateralLevel;
  497:     if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND) {
  498:       collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
  499:     } else {
  500:       multiplier = POINT_TWO;
  501:       assetSupply = levSupply;
  502:       collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
  503: 
  504:       if (assetSupply == 0) {
  505:         revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
  506:       }
  507:     }
  508:     
  509:     // Calculate the redeem rate based on the collateral level and token type
  510:     uint256 redeemRate;
  511:     if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
  512:       redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
  513:     } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
  514:       redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
  515:     } else {
  516:       redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
  517:     }
  518: 
  519:     if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) { //audit:info: if market is selected then the conversion rate below is wrong
  520:       redeemRate = marketRate; //audit
  521:     }
  522:     
  523:     // Calculate and return the final redeem amount
  524:     return ((depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) / ethPrice) / PRECISION; //audit: 
  525:   }

```

The `redeem` function has an additional protection against "manipulating" the exchange rate, namely the exchange takes place either at the rate from the system or at the rate from an external dex, depending on which is lower.

There is also a problem here, because `redeemRate` is calculated based on data from the system (BOND_TARGET_PRICE defined in USD) and the Chainlink oracle will be in USD, and marketRate will be in USDC.

Ultimately, if `marketRate` is taken as `redeemRate`, depending on how the USDC rate deviates from USD:
- if it deviates to the plus, then theoretically the user will lose, but he agrees to `minAmount` so it should be ok,
- if it deviates to the minus, then the protocol will suffer a loss, because the user will get a better rate

To sum up, regardless of the adopted value of BOND_TARGET_PRICE (USD or USDC), in the system we have an inconsistent source of price data as to the unit. The system will, under certain conditions, incorrectly treat data in USDC and USD units as equal, which will lead to a protocol loss or a loss for the user. Since the difference in value can be significant, and in the case of some random large USDC depg events even very significant, the loss may be greater than the allowable minimum significant loss, which is 0.01%.
