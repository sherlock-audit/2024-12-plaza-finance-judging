# Token Loss During `BalancerRouter` Deposit to `PreDeposit` Contract

### Summary

This audit report highlights a critical vulnerability observed during the `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` function. The function interacts with the `Balancer Router` contract, allowing users to transfer their assets. Subsequently, the `_deposit` function within the `Pre-Deposit` contract enforces a `reserve cap`.
If the user attempts to deposit an amount exceeding the` reserveCap`, the `_deposit` function reduces the deposit amount to match the available capacity.
Crucially, the difference between the intended deposit amount and the actual deposited amount is not refunded to the user. This results in an unexpected and irreversible loss of tokens for the user.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L23C1-L40C6 
In function `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` step one calls `joinBalancerPool` which lets user transfer their assets , and in step 3 deposit function of `preDeposit` contract is calling with the same number of tokens , but if u see `_deposit` function carefully there is a check 
```solidity


    // if user would like to put more than available in cap, fill the rest up to cap and add that to reserves
    if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
      amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
    }
```
and later only the decresed amount is deposited to the `predeposit` contract , but the difference amount is never refunded back to the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users loose a portion of their funding during deposits , leading to significant financial losses.

### PoC

Lets say the User wanted to deposit  `100Weth`
User transfers `100Weth` to `BalancerRouter` Contract via `joinBalancerAndPredeposit`
Lets say `reservecap` in `PreDeposit is `200weth` and `Reserveamount` is `150weth`
while checking in deposit function 
reserveAmount + amount = 150+ 100 = 250
250 >= 200 (True)
amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount = 200 - 150 = 50
Result:

The amount is adjusted to 50, ensuring that the total reserves after the addition will be exactly 200 (the reserveCap). 

now only 50 is deposited into the preDeposit contract , the other 50eth (differnce tokens ) is not refunded to user

### Mitigation

Implement a Refund Mechanism
