# ### In  `balanceRouter::joinBalancerPool` there was No validation that assets.length matches maxAmountsIn.length

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L72

### summary
The function `joinBalancerPool` expects two arrays (assets and maxAmountsIn) to be passed in. It iterates through assets to transfer tokens and approve them for the balancerVault. If these arrays do not have the same length, the loop will iterate over the shorter array, potentially causing runtime errors when accessing `maxAmountsIn[i]` if `i` exceeds the length of maxAmountsIn.

### Root Cause
Lack of Input Validation: The function does not validate that the lengths of the assets and maxAmountsIn arrays match.

```javascript 
function joinBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
       

==>> no validation before looping

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]);
        }
```
will attempt to access maxAmountsIn[i] even if i exceeds the length of the maxAmountsIn array, causing a revert. Even though the transaction reverts, gas is consumed up to the point of failure, and the transaction occupies block space.

### Impact
Attackers can repeatedly submit transactions with mismatched array lengths to spam the network, artificially increasing demand and driving up gas prices for everyone.The function can be exploited to fill the network mempool and block space with transactions designed to fail, consuming computational resources and slowing down the processing of legitimate transactions.

### Attack path

The attacker crafts a transaction with mismatched array lengths for the assets and maxAmountsIn parameters (e.g., assets.length = 10, maxAmountsIn.length = 2).

- Execution:

The attacker submits multiple transactions with these inputs, causing the joinBalancerPool function to revert each time due to an out-of-bounds array access.

- Impact on the Network:

These invalid transactions are included in the mempool and blocks, consuming gas and block space.
Legitimate users face increased gas costs and slower transaction processing.



### Mitigation
Before iterating through the arrays, add a check to ensure assets.length equals maxAmountsIn.length.

```diff

 function joinBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
       

+    require (maxAmountsIn.length == assets.length, "Array lengths do not match" )
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]);
        }

        IVault.JoinPoolRequest memory request = IVault.JoinPoolRequest({
            assets: assets,
            maxAmountsIn: maxAmountsIn,
            userData: userData,
            fromInternalBalance: false
        });

```
