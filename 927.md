# Governance can set pool sale limit higher than the max limit

### Summary

The setPoolSaleLimit function allows the governance to set the pool sale limit, but it fails to adhere to the documented constraint that the sale limit should be capped at 95%. The documentation specifies that the maximum value should be 95%, but the current implementation does not enforce this limit.



### Root Cause

**Problem:** The function allows the governance to set the pool sale limit without enforcing the 95% maximum specified in the documentation. This could allow governance to set a value higher than 95%, contradicting the intended design and documentation https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L176-L183.

### Impact

**Inconsistent with Documentation:** The function allows governance to bypass the 95% limit stated in the documentation, potentially leading to confusion or abuse.
**Potential for Unintended Behavior:** If the sale limit is set too high, it could lead to unforeseen issues or conflicts with the protocol's intended mechanics.
