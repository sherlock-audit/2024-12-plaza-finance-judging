# Incorrect Bid Sorting in Auction Contract Will Cause Financial Loss for Beneficiaries and Legitimate Bidders

### Summary

**An inverted price comparison in `Auction.sol#L200-206` will cause direct financial loss for auction beneficiaries and unfair exclusion for legitimate bidders as attackers can place low-value bids that displace higher-value bids during sorting.** The flawed logic in `insertSortedBid` prioritizes lower-priced bids over higher ones, causing the protocol to retain inferior bids during excess removal, thereby reducing total reserve proceeds and allowing attackers to "outcompete" better offers illegitimately.

### Root Cause

**In [`Auction.sol#L200-206`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L200-L206), the price comparison logic for bid sorting inverts the cross-multiplication terms, causing bids to be ordered by ascending price instead of descending.** 

The code attempts to sort bids by price (`buyReserveAmount / sellCouponAmount`) in descending order using cross-multiplication to avoid division. However, it incorrectly calculates:
```solidity
leftSide = newSellCouponAmount * currentBuyReserveAmount; // Should be newBuyReserveAmount * currentSellCouponAmount
rightSide = currentSellCouponAmount * newBuyReserveAmount; // Should be currentBuyReserveAmount * newSellCouponAmount

if (leftSide > rightSide || (leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount > currentSellCouponAmount)) {
    break;
}
```
This computes `(newSell * currentBuy) > (currentSell * newBuy)` instead of the correct `(newBuy * currentSell) > (currentBuy * newSell)`, effectively comparing `(currentPrice > newPrice)` instead of `(newPrice > currentPrice)`. 

While the tie-breaker `newSellCouponAmount > currentSellCouponAmount` is correct for secondary sorting (descending `sellCouponAmount` at equal prices), the **primary price comparison is inverted**, leading to lower-priced bids being prioritized over higher-priced ones.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Auction is active**: The auction must be in the `BIDDING` state (i.e., `block.timestamp < endTime`).
2. **Higher-priced bids exist**: At least one legitimate bidder submits a bid with a higher price (`buyReserveAmount / sellCouponAmount`) than the attacker’s bid.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker submits low-priced bid**:  
   Attacker calls `bid(buyReserveAmount=100, sellCouponAmount=100)`, creating a bid with price `1.0` (100/100). Due to the inverted comparison, this bid is placed **higher** in the sorted list than a legitimate bid with price `1.5`.

2. **Legitimate user submits higher-priced bid**:  
   User calls `bid(buyReserveAmount=150, sellCouponAmount=100)`, creating a bid with price `1.5`. The flawed logic in `insertSortedBid` places this bid **below** the attacker’s lower-priced bid.

3. **Auction reaches capacity**:  
   The aggregated `currentCouponAmount` exceeds `totalBuyCouponAmount` (e.g., total = 200, current = 250), triggering `removeExcessBids`.

4. **Excess bids removed incorrectly**:  
   `removeExcessBids` iterates from the "lowest" bid (which is actually the legitimate bid due to sorting errors). The legitimate bid (150 reserve tokens) is removed first, while the attacker’s bid (100 reserve tokens) remains.

5. **Auction concludes with inferior bids**:  
   The auction retains the attacker’s lower-priced bid, reducing total reserve proceeds. Legitimate bidders are refunded, losing their opportunity to participate.

### Impact

**The auction beneficiary suffers direct financial loss due to retained lower-value bids, while legitimate bidders lose allocated slots unfairly.** 

- **Beneficiary Loss**:  
  The protocol retains lower-priced bids (e.g., `100 reserve tokens` for `100 coupons`) instead of higher-priced bids (e.g., `150 reserve tokens` for `100 coupons`). For each displaced bid, the beneficiary loses `(higherPrice - lowerPrice) * sellCouponAmount` (e.g., `50 reserve tokens` per `100 coupons`). Loss scales linearly with the number of exploited bids.

- **Legitimate Bidder Exclusion**:  
  Higher-priced bids are refunded during excess removal despite offering better value. Bidders incur gas costs for failed transactions and lose auction participation opportunities, damaging protocol trust.

- **Systemic Risk**:  
  Attackers can systematically exploit the flaw to displace competitive bids, reducing the protocol’s auction efficiency and long-term viability.

### Mitigation

**Fix the inverted price comparison in `insertSortedBid` to prioritize higher-priced bids correctly:**

1. **Cross-Multiplication Logic**:  
   Swap the terms in the price comparison to align with `newPrice > currentPrice`:
   ```solidity
   // Before (incorrect):
   leftSide = newSellCouponAmount * currentBuyReserveAmount;
   rightSide = currentSellCouponAmount * newBuyReserveAmount;
   
   // After (correct):
   leftSide = newBuyReserveAmount * currentSellCouponAmount;
   rightSide = currentBuyReserveAmount * newSellCouponAmount;
   ```

2. **Tie-Breaker Logic**:  
   Keep the secondary sort by `sellCouponAmount` in **descending order** but only after fixing the primary price comparison:
   ```solidity
   if (leftSide > rightSide || (leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount > currentSellCouponAmount)) {
       break;
   }
   ```
