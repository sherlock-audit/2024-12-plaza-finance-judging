# Once the total supply of `LeverageToken` reaches 0, it will never be minted again.

### Summary

The `Pool.getCreateAmount()` function reverts when the total supply of `LeverageToken` is 0. This means that once the total supply reaches 0, creating `LeverageToke`n becomes impossible, effectively breaking the entire protocol.

### Root Cause

The [getCreateAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L329-L338) function always reverts if a user tries to create `LeverageToken` when the total supply is 0. You can verify this at line 330 and line 335.

Thus, once the total supply of `LeverageToken` reaches 0, `LeverageToken` can never be created again, resulting in the protocol being unable to operate.

Once all `LeverageToken`s are redeemed and the `collateralLevel` falls to `<= 120%`, then `BondToken` holders cannot redeem all their funds, as only `80%` of TVL is allocated for `BondToken` holders.

```solidity
      function getCreateAmount(
        ...

        if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
330       if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
            revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
          }
          creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;
        } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
335       if (assetSupply == 0) {
            revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
          }

          ...
      }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Once the total supply of `LeverageToken` reaches 0, then the protocol cannot operate, and `BondToken` holders can't fully redeem their funds.

### PoC

### Mitigation

At the first mint of `LeverageToken`, transfer a small amount (dust) to `address(0)`.
