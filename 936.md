# code fails to correctly handle cases where the new bid has the highest priority.

### Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the insertSortedBid method of the Auction contract that can potentially mishandle bid prioritization and list insertion, compromising the auction's core sorting mechanism.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L177-L245

### Root Cause

The issue happens when:
1. A new bid has the highest priority compared to all existing bids.
2. The traversal loop (while (`currentBidIndex != 0`)) assumes the new bid will be inserted somewhere in the middle or end of the list.
3. If the new bid has the highest priority, the loop exits prematurely because the break condition is satisfied immediately for the highest bid.
However:
• The highest bid of the list (highestBidIndex) is not updated to the new bid.
• The new bid is not linked properly to the rest of the list. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L204-L206

Here, the loop breaks as soon as it finds a bid with a lower priority than the new bid. If the currentBidIndex at the start of the loop is the head bid (highestBidIndex), the loop breaks, but there’s no logic outside the loop to handle this special case of updating the Highest bid.

This results in the new bid being "lost" or incorrectly placed.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. highestBidIndex tracking
2. Bidding mechanism allows priority-based sorting
3. Linked list requires maintaining correct head and tail references

### External Pre-conditions

1. Auction contract uses a sorted linked list for bid management
2. Multiple bids with varying priorities exist
3. Auction mechanism relies on precise bid ordering

### Attack Path

Detailed Example of the Issue
1.	Initial List (Before Insertion):
a	Let's assume the list has the following bids:
b	Bid A (Index: 1): Priority = 10
c	Bid B (Index: 2): Priority = 5
d	Bid C (Index: 3): Priority = 3
e	highestBidIndex = 1, meaning Bid A is the head of the list.


2.	New Bid (Highest Priority):
a	A new bid (Bid D) is submitted with:
b	newSellCouponAmount = 50
c	newBuyReserveAmount = 1
d	Bid D has the highest priority (e.g., Priority = 100).

3.	What Happens in the Loop?
a	When the loop starts, currentBidIndex = 1 (the head bid, Bid A).

**The CALCULATION**:

        leftSide = newSellCouponAmount * currentBuyReserveAmount; // Priority of new bid
        rightSide = currentSellCouponAmount * newBuyReserveAmount; // Priority of current head bid

 Since leftSide > rightSide (Bid D > Bid A), the loop breaks immediately.

**WHAT GOES WRONG?**

4	The loop exits without:
a	Updating highestBidIndex to point to Bid D.
b	Linking Bid D to the rest of the list (Bid A, Bid B, Bid C).
c	As a result, Bid D is "lost" and not part of the list.

### Impact

1. High Severity
• Potential manipulation of bid priority
• Risk of incorrectly ordering bids
• Possible loss of highest-priority bid information

2. The vulnerability allows strategic manipulation of bid priorities, potentially enabling attackers to circumvent the auction's intended fairness and price discovery mechanisms.

3. The new bid is effectively "lost" in the linked list:
• highestBidIndex incorrectly points to Bid A.
• The new bid, which should have been the first element, is not properly linked.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix the issue, you need to handle the special case where the new bid has the highest priority by adding logic before the loop starts. The fix ensures that the highestBidIndex is updated when the new bid should replace the head.
