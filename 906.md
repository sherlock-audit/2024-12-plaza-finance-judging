# Once the Total Supply of `BondToken` Reaches 0, Creating or Redeeming Becomes Impossible

### Summary

The functions `Pool.getCreateAmount()` and `Pool.getRedeemAmount()` revert when the total supply of `BondToken` is 0. This means that once the total supply reaches 0, creating and redeeming any tokens becomes impossible, effectively breaking the entire protocol.

### Root Cause

The functions [getCreateAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L314) and [getRedeemAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L487) revert when `bondSupply` equals 0.

As a result, once the total supply of `BondToken` reaches 0, no tokens can be created or redeemed, rendering the protocol inoperable. After all `BondToken`s have been redeemed, `LeverageToken` holders will be unable to redeem their funds, which will remain stuck in the pool.

```solidity
      function getCreateAmount(
        ...

314     if (bondSupply == 0) {
          revert ZeroDebtSupply();
        }

        ...

--------------------

      function getRedeemAmount(
        ...

487     if (bondSupply == 0) {
          revert ZeroDebtSupply();
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Once the total supply of `BondToken` reaches 0, the protocol cannot operate, leaving `LeverageToken` holders' funds stuck within the protocol.

### PoC

### Mitigation

At the first mint of `BondToken`, transfer a small amount (dust) to address(0).
