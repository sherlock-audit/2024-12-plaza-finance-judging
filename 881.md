# Reduction of distributionPeriod will freeze coupon payments

### Summary

When an administrator shortens the distribution period in Pool.sol after significant time has passed since the last distribution, the auction timing requirements become mathematically impossible to satisfy. This effectively locks bondETH holders out of receiving their expected USDC coupon payments, as no new auctions can be initiated under the contradictory timing constraints.

**Please note: Although the admins are trusted, there is no documentation that points to the protocol being aware of this issue arising. Hence, I think it is a valid issue to report.**

### Root Cause

In the `Pool.sol` contract,

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L642-L647

The `setDistributionPeriod` function lacks validation checks to prevent setting a distribution period that would create an invalid auction window based on the last distribution timestamp. Once an invalid window is created, the mathematical constraints in the `startAuction` function make it impossible to satisfy the timing requirements.

It will be impossible to satisfy this condition:

Since `lastDistribution` can only be updated through a successful auction, and no auction can succeed, the system enters a coupon payment freeze.

The issue will arise when administrators may reasonably want to reduce distribution periods to increase payment frequency, unaware that such an action could inadvertently freeze the auction and coupon payment system.

Please note: Although the admins are trusted, there is no documentation that points to the protocol being aware of this issue arising. Hence, I think it is a valid issue to report.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call setDistributionPeriod() to change distributionPeriod from a larger value (e.g., 90 days) to a smaller value (e.g., 30 days) and let's say 40 days have passed since the last distribution period
2. lastDistribution timestamp must be set from a previous distribution
3. No auction should be currently in progress (NotInAuction modifier requirement)

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Protocol starts with a 90-day distribution period and `lastDistribution` set to January 1st
2. In mid February (after 40 days since the last distribution has passed), admin calls `setDistributionPeriod`(30 days) to reduce the period
3. The` startAuction()` function becomes mathematically impossible to execute because:

- First requirement: `block.timestamp > lastDistribution + distributionPeriod`
- Second requirement: `block.timestamp â‰¤ lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod`
- Once `block.timestamp` exceeds `lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod`, the second condition can never be satisfied
4. Since `lastDistribution` can only be updated through a successful auction, and no auction can succeed, the system enters a coupon payment freeze

### Impact

The bondETH holders lose their ability to receive USDC coupon payments as the auction mechanism becomes mathematically impossible to execute. This disrupts a core protocol promise of regular coupon payments. The only remedy requires governance intervention to modify the distribution parameters.

### PoC

The protocol begins with these parameters:

- Initial distribution period: 90 days
- Auction period: 3 days
- Last distribution timestamp: January 1st, 2024

On February 15th, 2024 (45 days into the distribution period), an admin decides to reduce the distribution period to 30 days to make coupon payments more frequent. 

This creates the following timing constraints:
For the next auction to start, two conditions must be simultaneously true:
1. The current time must be after January 1st + 30 days (January 31st)
2. The current time must be before or equal to January 1st + 30 days + 3 days (February 3rd)

However, since we're already at February 15th when the change is made, and the lastDistribution timestamp remains fixed at January 1st, starting an auction becomes impossible because:
1. The first condition requires us to be after January 31st (satisfied, as we're at February 15th)
2. The second condition requires us to be before or equal to February 3rd (impossible to satisfy, as we're already at February 15th and cannot move backwards in time)

This creates an auction freeze and hence in turn a coupon payments because:
1. We cannot satisfy both timing conditions simultaneously
2. The lastDistribution timestamp can only be updated by a successful auction
3. No auction can succeed due to the impossible timing conditions
4. This cycle cannot be broken without governance intervention to modify the core contract parameters

### Mitigation

The `setDistributionPeriod` function should include validation checks that prevent the creation of invalid auction windows.
