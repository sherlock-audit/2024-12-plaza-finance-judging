# Malicious Bond holders could claim coupon related to the eligible ones.

### Summary

According to the docs , [coupons](https://docs.plaza.finance/protocol-mechanics/claiming-coupons#:~:text=PROTOCOL%20MECHANICS-,Claiming%20Coupons,-Receiving%20USDC%20for) are distributed at a rate of 2.5 USDC per bond per quarter...**" even if they subsequently sold the `bondETH` "**.
The pool creates auctions to acquire coupon tokens for distribution. The number of coupon tokens is calculated based on bond supply at auction time:
```solidity
function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
    uint256 normalizedTotalSupply = bondToken.totalSupply().normalizeAmount(bondDecimals, maxDecimals);
    uint256 normalizedShares = sharesPerToken.normalizeAmount(sharesDecimals, maxDecimals);
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)
        .toBaseUnit(maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
}
```

### Root Cause

 The coupon calculation is fixed at auction start:
`uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)` 
while the Users can create bonds At any time in the cycle of a quarter after or during auction but before distribution:
`function create(TokenType tokenType, uint256 depositAmount, uint256 minAmount) external whenNotPaused() nonReentrant() returns(uint256)`
so when a user creates `BondETH `during an auction, their position is tracked in the current period (the one that was incremented by `increaseIndexedAssetPeriod`).
This happens through the [_update ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154)function in `BondToken `which is called during minting through `updateIndexedUserAsset `function .

However , The distributor allows [claims ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L78) without checking creation time: 
```solidity
function claim() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
    if (couponAmountToDistribute < shares) {
        revert NotEnoughSharesToDistribute();
    }
    couponAmountToDistribute -= shares;
    bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
}
```
As we can see , Users can create bonds in a running auction but before distribution and still claim ,The calculation uses:

1. Total supply of `bondETH `(`bondToken.totalSupply()`)
2. Shares per token (`sharesPerToken `parameter)

The key point is that this calculation happens at auction start, but the protocol doesn't restrict who can claim based on when they acquired their bonds.( I refer to the quarter condition ).

### Internal Pre-conditions

At auction start:

- Coupon calculation is fixed: `couponAmountToDistribute = totalSupply * sharesPerToken`
- A snapshot of period data is stored in `previousPoolAmounts`
- Period is incremented

### External Pre-conditions

**When new `BondETH `is created during auction:**

- User receives BondETH tokens
- Their balance is tracked in current period through _update function.
- `updateIndexedUserAssets `is called, storing their shares in current period.
But the auction's `couponAmountToDistribute `remains unchanged.

**At claim time:**

- `getIndexedUserAmount `will return shares for all users in the period.
- Including those who got `BondETH `after auction start.
- But available coupons were calculated based on pre-auction supply.

### Attack Path

The Vulnerability exist in that while the coupon calculation correctly accounts for `bondETH `holders at auction time, the claim mechanism doesn't differentiate between early and late depositors. New `bondETH `creation during auction Indexes holders in current period, making them eligible for claims. so the claim function Treats all indexed holders equally, regardless of when they acquired bonds . we can demonstrate the issue as follow :

- Eligible `BondEth `holder deposit from T1(0-3month counting) and wait a quarter just to have a coupon for each `bondETh `they hold, when T2 occur ( 10 days before distribution time happen ).

1. Auction starts with X total `bondETH `supply
2. Coupon amount calculated: X * `sharesPerToken`
3. New deposits increase total `bondETH `supply to Y , at T3 just after T2
4. Now Y holders are trying to claim coupons calculated for X holders

This creates a race condition where: 
```solidity
function claim() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
    if (couponAmountToDistribute < shares) {
        revert NotEnoughSharesToDistribute();
    }
    couponAmountToDistribute -= shares;
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
}
```
The function Checks if remaining `couponAmountToDistribute `covers the claim, If yes, processes the claim and reduces available amount ,If no, reverts.
So while there aren't enough coupons for all claims:

Early claimers get full amounts because sufficient coupons remain
Each successful claim reduces `couponAmountToDistribute`
Later claimers face reverts when `couponAmountToDistribute ` becomes insufficient.

### Impact

Early claimers can receive full amounts while later claims revert. This can cause coupons distribution for legitimate  holders to fail due to insufficient coupons.
