# Stuck funds if noone calls `distribute` after an auction ends and a new auction is started

### Summary

If an auction starts and it ends successfuly, the distribution is being stared. The `distribute` function can be called by anyone and the `bond` token holders are incentivised to call it so they receive their rewards. Although, if the distribution period ends, and noone calls `Pool::distribute`, a new auction could be started by anyone and therefore this will increase the indexed asset period:

This will leave people's funds locked. The likelihood of this happening is low, because bond holders are incentivised to call the `distribute` function, but the impact if this happens is high as there will be users funds locked. That's why I consider it a medium issue.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction must be successful

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Bob and Tommy are  bond token holders, waiting to receive his coupon tokens after the auction
2. Auction ends successfuly
3. Both Bob and Tommy by any reason doesn't call `distribute`
4. Alice which could be called "malicious" starts a new auction immediately after the distribution period ends. 
5. Bob and Tommy now have their funds stuck in the protocol

### Impact

Stuck funds in `Pool.sol` 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add some kind of "require" that no auction could be started before the `Pool::distribute` function is called
