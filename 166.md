# `BalancerRouter::joinBalancerPool` will revert if the tokens in the `assets` array is not in order as in the Balancer Pool.

### Summary

Tokens in assets array passed into [`BalancerRouter::joinBalancerPool`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L65C1-L90C6) must be in order as they appear from the result of Balancer's `PoolTokens::_getPoolTokens(poolId)`. The deposit function will revert if the tokens are not in the right order. 

The problem is that users do not know this order. Assume a user wants to deposit `4` tokens via Balancer pool, there are `24` possible ways of arranging the tokens and users cannot guess the right order.
