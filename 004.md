# [MEDIUM] Missed Checking of `registeredPools` and Unused Error PoolAlreadyRegistered in Distributor.sol

### Summary

The `Distributor.sol` contract includes the error `PoolAlreadyRegistered`, declared at line 40. However, this error is currently unused in the code. Its intended purpose appears to be preventing duplicate registration of pools, which would align with standard practices for managing pools in systems like this. The unused error brought attention to the fact that the `Distributor.sol::allocate()` function does not include a check to verify whether a pool has already been created, which results in a lack of proper constraints.
```solidity
@> error PoolAlreadyRegistered();
```

### Root Cause

The error `PoolAlreadyRegistered` is declared but never triggered. This oversight likely stems from missing logic for managing pool registration, leading to an incomplete implementation. Additionally, the absence of pool creation checks in the `Distributor.sol::allocate()`  function indicates a lack of verification, allowing potential duplicate pool registrations without any safeguard in place.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Code Redundancy: The presence of an unused error declaration increases cognitive load without contributing functionality.
- Lack of Constraint Enforcement: The absence of pool registration logic allows potential duplicate pool registrations, which could lead to undefined or erroneous behavior.
- Reduced Auditability: Without explicit error handling for duplicate pools, tracing issues becomes more difficult during debugging or external audits.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Introduce pool registration logic in the allocate function to ensure pools are registered once and prevent duplicate registrations. This also provides an opportunity to use the `PoolAlreadyRegistered` error effectively.
**Suggested Code Change:**
```diff
// Declare a mapping to keep track of registered pools
+ mapping(address => bool) private registeredPools;

function allocate(uint256 _amountToDistribute) external whenNotPaused {
    require(address(pool) == msg.sender, CallerIsNotPool());

+   // Check if the pool is already registered
+   if (registeredPools[address(pool)]) {
+       revert PoolAlreadyRegistered();
+   }

    // Register the pool
+   registeredPools[address(pool)] = true;

    address couponToken = pool.couponToken();
    couponAmountToDistribute += _amountToDistribute;

    if (IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < couponAmountToDistribute) {
        revert NotEnoughCouponBalance();
    }

    // Emit the PoolRegistered event for transparency
+   emit PoolRegistered(address(pool), couponToken);
}
```

2. Remove the unused error declaration from the contract to reduce gas costs and streamline the codebase. The removal will not affect the functionality of the contract as the event is not referenced elsewhere.
```diff
- error PoolAlreadyRegistered();
```

# Notes to Judge:
Hi dear Sherlock judge,

This is my first time participating in a competitive audit, and I hope you find my report well-prepared and in accordance with the rules and requirements outlined in the Sherlock audit guidelines.

If there are any areas where I’ve fallen short, I would greatly appreciate detailed feedback to ensure I improve in future reports. Of course, I completely understand if your schedule doesn’t allow for extensive feedback given the number of reports you have to review.

Wishing you a great day! Sending virtual cookies your way 🍪😊
