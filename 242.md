# If the previous fee was 0, then increasing the fee will apply the new fee retroactively on reserves before change.

## Bug description
As can be seen from the `setFee()` function, the only limitation on the fee set is it shouldn't be greater than 10%.

[Pool.sol#L674-L676](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L674-L676)
```solidity
function setFee(uint256 _fee) external onlyRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE()) {
    // Fee cannot exceed 10%
    require(_fee <= 100000, FeeTooHigh());
```

Before changing the fee, `claimFees()` is called to collect the fees to prevent the new fee being applied retroactively on reserves before change.

[Pool.sol#L678-L682](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L678-L682)
```solidity
// Force a fee claim to prevent governance from setting a higher fee
// and collecting increased fees on old deposits
if (getFeeAmount() > 0) {
    claimFees();
}
```

To achieve that, `claimFees()` will update `lastFeeClaimTime` variable to the current timestamp after collecting the fee.

[Pool.sol#L702-L709](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L702-L709)
```solidity
uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();
if (feeAmount == 0) {
    revert NoFeesToClaim();
}
lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
```

However, if the previous fee was 0 (which is a valid value), the if statement in the `claimFees()` function will not run, since when the fee is set to 0, `getFeeAmount()` will also return 0. That means that `lastFeeClaimTime` won't be updated to the current timestamp before the fee changes, thus the new fee will be applied retroactively on reserves before change.

## Root cause
Not updating `lastFeeClaimTime` timestamp when updating fee from 0 value.

## Attack path
Changing the fee from 0 to a non-zero value.

## Impact
The new fee can be applied retroactively on reserves before change.
## Recommended Mitigation
When updating the fee set the `lastFeeClaimTime` variable to the current timestamp even when the `getFeeAmount()` returns 0.
