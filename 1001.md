# Absent validation for `answer` value in the OracleReader SC

### Summary

The vulnerability involves the conversion between different integer types in Solidity, specifically converting a signed integer (`int256`) to an unsigned integer (`uint256`). This kind of conversion can introduce bugs when the value in the signed integer is negative, as Solidity does not check for invalid conversions during this process.

### Root Cause

The [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L68) on the possible vulnerability in the `OracleReader` smart contract.

The `getOraclePrice()` function in the `OracleReader SC` expects the correct `answer` value from the oracle. However, this answer has `int256` type on the oracle side. In Solidity, when a value from an `int256` type is converted to `uint256`, no automatic checks are performed to ensure that the value is non-negative. Instead, the binary representation of the `int256` is reinterpreted as `uint256`, potentially leading to very large positive values if the original `int256` value was negative.

In the provided function:

```solidity
(,int256 answer,,uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
```

The `answer` retrieved is an `int256` value, and when the function returns this value, it performs this conversion explicitly without checking the sign:

```solidity
return isInverted ? (10 ** decimals * 10 ** decimals) / uint256(answer) : uint256(answer);
```

### Attack Path




### Impact

If `answer` is negative the binary representation of a negative `int256` value will be converted to a very large `uint256` value. This can lead to severe logical errors, especially in financial computations where the price needs to be accurate. For instance, converting `-1` as `int256` to `uint256` results in `2^256 - 1`, which is a very large number, clearly not the intended outcome if imagined as a price.

Any logic that depends on this price could behave erratically or enter undesirable states due to the unintentionally large values, potentially draining funds or causing logic errors in other parts of the system. In addition, the attacker can manipulate the computed price by making it astronomically high when it's converted to `uint256`.

### Mitigation

Before performing the conversion, explicitly check if the `answer` is non-negative. If it is negative, revert or handle it according to the requirements of your contract.
