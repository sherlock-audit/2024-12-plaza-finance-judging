# Deploying with invalid addresses like zero addresses could result in non functional proxy contracts

#### Lack of Input Address Validation

#### Impact
Deploying with invalid addresses (e.g., zero address) could result in non-functional proxy contracts or uninitialized contracts, leading to loss of funds or operational failures.

The Deployer contract does not validate the input addresses provided to the deployment functions (bondBeacon, leverageBeacon, distributorBeacon, etc.). Passing zero or invalid addresses as parameters could result in:
1. Proxies being linked to an uninitialized or incorrect logic contract.
2. Contracts deployed in a broken or unusable state, leading to potential disruptions or financial loss.

#### Proof of Concept (PoC)
Here is an example scenario demonstrating the issue:

1. A user calls deployBondToken with bondBeacon set to the zero address:
   ```solidity
   deployBondToken(
       address(0),           // Invalid beacon address
       "BondToken",
       "BOND",
       minter,
       governance,
       poolFactory,
       sharesPerToken
   );
   ```
2. This will result in the creation of a BeaconProxy pointing to a non-existent implementation contract. The deployed proxy will fail when trying to execute any functions.

3. Similarly, providing invalid addresses for minter, governance, or poolFactory could result in improper initialization, leading to malfunctioning tokens or access control vulnerabilities.

#### Recommended Mitigation
Add address validation checks in each deployment function to ensure that the provided addresses are not zero address and possibly verify contract-specific addresses using Address.isContract.

Hereâ€™s an updated version of the deployBondToken function with validation:
```solidity
function deployBondToken(
    address bondBeacon,
    string memory name,
    string memory symbol,
    address minter,
    address governance,
    address poolFactory,
    uint256 sharesPerToken
) external returns (address) {
    require(bondBeacon != address(0), "Deployer: bondBeacon is zero address");
    require(minter != address(0), "Deployer: minter is zero address");
    require(governance != address(0), "Deployer: governance is zero address");
    require(poolFactory != address(0), "Deployer: poolFactory is zero address");

    return address(new BeaconProxy(
        address(bondBeacon),
        abi.encodeCall(
            BondToken.initialize, (name, symbol, minter, governance, poolFactory, sharesPerToken)
        )
    ));
}
```
Repeat similar checks for other deployment functions (deployLeverageToken and deployDistributor) to ensure all critical addresses are validated.
