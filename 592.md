# Unfair removal of lowest bid when removing excess bids

### Summary

The `Auction` contract allows for partial reduction of bids in the event the `currentCouponAmount` exceeds the allowed `totalBuyCouponAmount` via `removeExcessBids (...)` function. The function determines the amount to remove as `uint256 amountToRemove = currentCouponAmount - totalBuyCouponAmount;`.  It starts from the lowest bid and determines whether to remove the entire lowest bid or only partially so that it does not exceed `totalBuyCouponAmount` as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L250-L292) The amount to remove is determined and the refund is returned to the bidder. 

During bidding in the `bid (...)` function, there is a granularity check as `if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0)` revert InvalidSellAmount();
`. During partial liquidation the contract reduces a bidâ€™s `sellCouponAmount` by exactly the `amountToRemove` needed. 

Now follow the following simplified example for clarity:
1. There is an action of `totalBuyCouponAmount` of 100 tokens and `maxBids` of 2. 
2. Bidder 1 bids 97 tokens
3. Bidder 2 bids 5 tokens to ensure this check ``if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0)` passes. 
This will reduce the excess tokens and store the lowest bid as 3. 
4. Another user will come and call `bid (...)` function with 5 tokens, which will remove the second bidder and replaces him with this bidder although the amount they adding is the same amount. 
5. This will be unfair to the lowest bidder because in the event the bids are the same, the first bid should be prioritized.

### Root Cause

The `removeExcessBids (...)` function is called within the `bid (...)` function as seen here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L250-L292
