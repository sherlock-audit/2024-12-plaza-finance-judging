# The protocol will sacrifice excessive totalSellReserveAmount at marginally better prices due to open bid auction prioritization logic.

### Summary

The prioritization logic in Auction.sol and its interaction with Pool.sol leads to higher `totalSellReserveAmount` being sacrificed during auction success. This occurs because the auction succeeds whenever [`currentCouponAmount == totalBuyCouponAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L339-L340), but the protocol transfers reserves (`totalSellReserveAmount`) to the auction based on all accepted bids, even if those bids provide only marginal improvements in implied price. This inefficiency is amplified as long as the [`poolSaleLimit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341-L342) isn't exceeded.

### Root Cause

The choice to design the auction as an open-price auction with real-time prioritization is a mistake, as the bid prioritization logic allows for strategic manipulation. Specifically:

- The prioritization formula (sellCouponAmount/buyReserveAmount) enables bidders to achieve inclusion by slightly increasing `sellCouponAmount` while maintaining the same implied price. 
- This behavior (hovering in the lower bids) sacrifices more of the protocol's `sellReserveToken` than necessary, reducing efficiency.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The auction is active and allows bidding ([`auctionActive()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L386-L392) modifier).
2. The current total coupon amount (`currentCouponAmount`) is close to the limit (`totalBuyCouponAmount`).
3. Bidders monitor emitted events from [BidPlaced](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L168), [BidRemoved](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L327), and [BidReduced](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L289) or inspect the blockchain to observe the lowest-priority bid (`lowestBidIndex`) in terms of its `buyReserveAmount` and `sellCouponAmount`.
4. A low-priority bid exists that can be out-prioritized by a marginally better bid.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Gas prices are low enough to incentivize last-second bidding.
2. The auction is visible to all participants (e.g., through blockchain explorers or bots monitoring emitted events).

### Attack Path

1. A bidder monitors the [`lowestBidIndex`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L53) and determines the implied price of the current lowest-priority [bids](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L39-L48).
2. Throughout the auction period, and especially close to the auction's end, the bidder [game the auction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L173-L176) by placing a new bid with:
- The same implied price as the lowest bid.
- A slightly higher `sellCouponAmount` (e.g. by an additional [slot](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L378-L384)) to achieve inclusion.
3. This bid causes the lowest-priority bid to be removed and/or the auction to reach its coupon limit (`totalBuyCouponAmount`) via removeExcessBids() on the attacker's bid. (Note: This behavior will not be easily manipulated if the auction has been designed as close/blind bid that pretty much encourages bidding up for more viably successful bid.)
4. The protocol ends up consuming more `sellReserveToken` to satisfy the marginally better bid, leading to unintended loss.

```solidity
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
```

### Impact

The protocol suffers inefficiency due to excessive `totalSellReserveAmount` sacrificed than intended during auction success. This can deplete the protocol's reserves over time and reduce its ability to conduct future auctions effectively.

### Mitigation

The best option is to implement close bid auction. If not, here are some of the suggestions:
 
1. Introduce Time-Weighted Priority:
- Earlier bids receive higher priority to discourage last-second strategic bidding.
2. Set Minimum Implied Price Threshold:
- Reject bids that do not exceed a dynamic minimum price (e.g., based on the current average).
