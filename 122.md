# Failed auctions lead to coupon distribution DoS

### Summary

Indexed amount of shares is always increased at the beginning of every auction while funds (USDC) to distribute are sent to the distributor ***only if*** auction succeeds.

### Root Cause

In Pool.sol:567 the indexed asset period is increased as soon as an auction for the current distribution period is deployed:

However, in the case when the auction failed, the reserve asset would not be sold and thus USDC (coupons) would not be sent to the pool. Additionally, an auction will be marked as failed. This will make it impossible to distribute coupon funds to the Distributor contract for the current period:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L597-L602

As a result, the Distributor would not have funds to cover the last distribution period (where an action failed) but at the same time, because the distribution period was incremented, bondETH holders become eligible for those rewards. They can claim their share of USDC coupons at the expense of users who have not claimed their coupons from the previous periods until the point the Distributor contract would not have funds to cover further claims thus leading to DoS.

It is worth noting that `Distributor.claim()` function tries to claim the entire amount of coupons that a user is eligible for, making it impossible to make a partial withdrawal, which worsens the situation.

Another important note is that only one auction per distribution period is possible therefore the lack of USDC funds will only grow with each failed auction making the Distributor contract insolvency state permanent.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction fails

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice and Bob purchase bondETH.
2. Auction for 2025 Q1 run and succeded => funds to cover coupons for Q1 are sent to the Distributor.
3. Bob claims coupons for Q1, but Alice does not.
4. Auction for 2025 Q2 run and failed => no funds sent to the Distributor.
5. Bob claims coupons for Q2 because the Distributor had Alice's coupons for Q1 unclaimed
6. Alice comes to claim but now it reverts because the Distributor does not have funds to serve Alice.

### Impact

1. Some users can claim funds even for failed distribution periods at the expense of other users.
2. The rest of the users will get claim reversal because the Distributor runs out of funds.
3. Distributor permanent state of insolvency (inability to serve correctly and in full all bondETH holders).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the indexed amount of shares only on the auction success.
