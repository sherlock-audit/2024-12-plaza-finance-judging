# Users Are Vulnerable to Dosing Due to Slippage


### Summary
Users are easily dosed around the `collateralLevel = 1.2`.

### Root Cause
At or near a `collateralLevel` of 1.2, the price curve is not continuous, and its fluctuation range can be as high as 20%.

### PoC
When buying and selling levEth:
`tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserve)`, `collateralLevel = tvl / (bondSupply * 100)`.
If `collateralLevel <= 1.2`, `creationRate = tvl * 0.2 / levSupply`.
If `collateralLevel > 1.2`,  `creationRate = (tvl - 100 * bondSupply) / levSupply`.

If `collateralLevel = 1.2`, `creationRate = (120 * bondSupply) * 0.2 / levSupply = 24 * bondSupply / levSupply`.
If `collateralLevel = 1.2 + eps/100, (0 < eps : very small)`
    `creationRate = {[(120 + eps) * bondSupply] - 100  * bondSupply} / levSupply = (20 + eps) * bondSupply / levSupply`.

Therefore, around the `collateralLevel = 1.2`, the price fluctuation rate reaches `(24 / 20 - 1) = 20%`.
As a result, at this position, users are easily dosed.

In sherlock rule:
>The issue causes funds to be locked for more than a week.
>The issue impacts the availability of time-sensitive functions (cutoff functions are not considered time-sensitive).
>If at least one of these is describing the case, the issue can be Medium.

The `create()` function is time-sensitive function, because the price used in this fucntion is value that keep changing.

### Impact
Users are vulnerable to dosing around the `collateralLevel = 1.2`.

### Mitigation
Consider adjusting the threshold of the `collateralLevel` to `1.25`. 
Alternatively, consider setting the collateral value percentage to `16.66%` instead of `20%` for levETH.
