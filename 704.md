# When redeeming leverageTokens, marketRate of bondTokens should not effect the redemption.

### Summary

In the [getRedeemAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L519), used to calculate the amount of `reserveTokens` when redeeming bond or leverage tokens, `marketRate` of `bondTokens` is used to ensure that `bondTokens` are redeemed with the `marketRate` at most. However, this effects the redemption of `leverageTokens` too. If the market rate of `bondTokens` is lower than the `redeemRate` of `leverageTokens`, when users redeem `everageTokens`, they will be get back `reserveTokens` based on the `marketRate` of `bondTokens` and not the `redeemRate` of `leverageTokens`.

### Root Cause

Before calculating the redeem amount, the `marketRate` is calculated as follows in the [`simulateRedeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L446) to be passed into the `getRedeemAmount()`. 

```solidity
 marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD)
        .normalizeAmount(
          getOracleDecimals(address(bondToken), USD), 
          oracleDecimals 
        );

```

In the [`getRedeemAmount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L519) the `marketRate` is used as the `redeemRate`, when it is non-zero and less than `redeemRate`.

```solidity 
    if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
      redeemRate = marketRate;
    }

```

The function fails to check whether the user is redeeming bond or leverage tokens, even though the `marketRate` is based on `BondTokens` . When the `marketRate` of `bondTokens` is lower than the `redeemRate` of `leverageTokens`, this will causes user to get `reserveTokens` with the rate of `bondTokens` when they are redeeming `leverageTokens`. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

The `marketRate` of `bondTokens` need to be lower than the `redeemRate` of `leverageTokens`.


### External Pre-conditions

Users need to redeem `leverageTokens`, when the `marketRate` of `bondTokens` is lower than the `redeemRate` of `leverageTokens`.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will make users receive incorrect amounts of `reserveTokens` when redeeming.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check to ensure the `marketRate` only effects the redemption of `bondTokens`.

```diff

-    if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
      redeemRate = marketRate;
    }

+   if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate && tokenType == TokenType.BOND) {
      redeemRate = marketRate;
    }
