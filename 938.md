## Summary
It is possible to manipulate the price of the BondToken by constructing a dexPool.

```javascript
  function getPool(address tokenA, address tokenB) private view returns (address, uint24, int24) {
    // this only works for Aerodrome, they decided to break compatibility with getPool mapping
@>    int24[5] memory spacing = [int24(1), int24(50), int24(100), int24(200), int24(2000)];

    for (uint24 i = 0; i < spacing.length; i++) {
      try ICLFactory(dexFactory).getPool(tokenA, tokenB, spacing[i]) returns (address _pool) {
        if (_pool == address(0)) continue;
        
        // Aerodrome CL specific
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = dexFactory.staticcall(abi.encodeWithSignature("tickSpacingToFee(int24)", spacing[i]));
        if (!success) continue;
        
        return (_pool, abi.decode(data, (uint24)), spacing[i]);

      } catch {}
    }

    revert NoPoolFound();
  }
```


In the BondOracleAdapter, the getPool() function is used to obtain the dexPool. However, in getPool(), the pool is selected by iterating through the values in the spacing array. Suppose the admin adds real liquidity in the Aerodrome DEX, selecting a tickSpacing of 100. An attacker can use the same tokens on Aerodrome DEX to select a tickSpacing of 1, thereby creating a new dexPool. Since the iteration in getPool() starts from 1, it will select the dexPool created by the attacker.

The attacker can then add a very small amount of liquidity tokens to their dexPool to manipulate the price.

Furthermore, the BondOracleAdapter contract does not have any other functions to set the dexPool, which leads to the price of the BondToken being manipulated.
## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path
1.	The attacker notices that the admin has created a BondToken pool on the Aerodrome DEX.
2.	The attacker then creates a pool with a smaller tickSpacing.
3.	The attacker adds a very small amount of tokens to the pool to manipulate the price.

Additionally, even if the pool used is the one created by the admin, if the liquidity in the pool is relatively low, it can still be easily manipulated by the attacker.

## Impact
The price of BondToken is manipulated, causing financial losses to the protocol.

## PoC

## Mitigation
Add a function for the administrator to set the dexPool.
