# The fee calculations in the `pool` contract are incorrect, with different total fee amounts calculated during user creation/redeem and when the `feeBeneficiary` claims.

## Summary
The fee calculated during `create` and `redeem` differs from the fee transferred to the `feeBeneficiary` due to the use of `block.timestamp`. Different amounts are deducted while `create`/`redeem`, and a separate amount is transferred to the `feeBeneficiary`.

## Vulnerability Details
The fee calculation in the `simulateCreate` and  `simulateRedeem` is given below ->

The fee is time based means more time passes more will be the fee amount is deducated from the `poolReserves`.
Same is implemented in the `getFeeAmount` which is called from `claimFees` function in `pool` contract  ->
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L719

When a user creates or redeems tokens, the fee is deducted from the `poolReserves`. However, when the `feeBeneficiary` calls `claimFees`, a different fee amount is calculated due to the use of `block.timestamp`. This discrepancy results in an incorrect amount of `poolReserves` being distributed to the `feeBeneficiary`, differing from the amount calculated during the user's action.



## Impact
1. A different fee is transferred to the `feeBeneficiary` than the one calculated during the user's `create`/`redeem` due to the use of `block.timestamp`.
2. If `block.timestamp` becomes large enough that after sending the reserve amount to the `Auction`, the remaining balance in the pool is less than the fee, the `feeBeneficiary` will be unable to withdraw the fee.


## Recommendations
1.Calculate the fee based on time when the user creates or redeems, but do not recalculate the fee when the `feeBeneficiary` wants to withdraw.
2. Store the fee calculated when the user creates or redeems in a variable, and then send the stored amount to the `feeBeneficiary`.
