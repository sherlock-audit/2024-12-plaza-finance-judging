# Double Distribution and Insufficient Fund Risk in the distribute() Function of the Pool Contract

### Summary

The lack of a state variable to track whether distribution has already occurred for a specific auction period will cause double distribution and fund loss for the protocol as the ```distribute()``` function can be called multiple times for the same auction period, leading to leftover USDC in the pool and financial discrepancies.


### Root Cause

In the [Pool.sol:589](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589) contract, the lack of a state variable to track whether distribution has already occurred for a specific auction period is a mistake as it allows the distribute() function to be called multiple times for the same auction period, leading to potential double distribution and insufficient funds in the pool.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction for period N-1 is ended.
2. New Auction for period N is started.
3. Any user call ```distribute()``` function.
4. Auction for period N is ended.
5. Any user call ```distribute()``` function again.

### External Pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. An auction sets the ```currentPeriod``` to 5 by calling the function to start the auction.
2. The auction ends, and the ```totalBuyCouponAmount``` for period 5 is finalized in the auction contract.
3. A new auction participant starts a new auction, updating the ```currentPeriod``` to 6.
4. Any user calls the ```distribute()``` function, which attempts to distribute the ```totalBuyCouponAmount``` from period 5.
5. After a period of time, the auction for period 6 ends, finalizing its ```totalBuyCouponAmount```.
6. Any user calls the ```distribute()``` function again immediately after the auction for period 6 ends.
7. Since the ```currentPeriod``` is still 6, the distribution logic references period 5 again, potentially leading to double distribution of funds if not properly tracked, resulting in leftover USDC in the pool and financial discrepancies.

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of USDC intended for distribution to users. The affected users may not receive their expected coupon amounts, leading to financial discrepancies and a loss of trust in the protocol's reliability.

### Mitigation

### **Option 1: Introduce a State Variable for Distribution Tracking**

1. **Add a State Variable:**
Introduce a mapping or boolean variable in the Pool contract to track whether distribution has already occurred for each auction period.
```solidity
mapping(uint256 => bool) public hasDistributed;
```

2. **Modify the distribute() Function:**
Before executing the distribution logic, check if distribution has already occurred for the previous period.
```solidity
require(!hasDistributed[previousPeriod], "Distribution already occurred for this period");
```
3. **Set the State After Distribution:**
After successfully transferring USDC and updating allocations, set the state variable to true.
```solidity
hasDistributed[previousPeriod] = true;
```

### **Option 2: Approve USDC Transfer and Use transferFrom**

1. **Approve USDC Transfer:**

In the Auction contract, ensure that USDC is approved for transfer to the Pool contract before calling the distribute() function.
```solidity
IERC20(couponToken).approve(address(pool), totalBuyCouponAmount);
```
2. **Modify the distribute() Function:**
Replace the direct transfer of USDC with a call to ```safeTransferFrom``` within the ```distribute()``` function. This ensures that the amount received in the Pool contract matches the auction's ```totalBuyCouponAmount```.
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20(couponToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), couponAmountToDistribute);
uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this));

require(balanceAfter - balanceBefore == couponAmountToDistribute, "Mismatch in transferred amount");
```
