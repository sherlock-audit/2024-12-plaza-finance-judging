# Incorrect Period Reference in `transferReserveToAuction` Leading to Denial of Service for Auction Contracts

### Summary

The function `transferReserveToAuction` is intended to be called by the most recently deployed auction contract. However, it retrieves the auction contract address using `address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];`, which will always return the zero address. This occurs because `currentPeriod` is incremented when an auction is deployed, and the correct last deployed auction address can only be accessed using `auctions[currentPeriod - 1]`.

### Root Cause

In `Pool::startAuction`, when an auction contract is deployed, the mapping of periods to auction addresses is updated as follows: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L552

```solidity
auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
    address(new Auction()),
    abi.encodeWithSelector(
        Auction.initialize.selector,
        address(couponToken),
        address(reserveToken),
        couponAmountToDistribute,
        block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
        1000,
        address(this),
        poolSaleLimit
    )
);
```

After this, the `bondToken::increaseIndexedAssetPeriod` function increments `globalPool.currentPeriod` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L225).  As a result, the updated `currentPeriod` does not correspond to any address in the mapping, and the most recently deployed auction contract can only be accessed using `currentPeriod - 1`.

However, in `Pool::transferReserveToAuction`, the following code is used:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L579C45-L579C46


```solidity
(uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    
address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());

IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
```

At this point, the last deployed auction contract is expected to call this function. Therefore, the correct index to access its address in the mapping should be `currentPeriod - 1`.


### Impact


This issue creates a **Denial of Service (DoS)** for the auction contract, preventing it from accessing reserve tokens. As a result, the auction cannot proceed, leading to a **loss of revenue for bondToken holders** who depend on the auction's successful completion for their returns.


### Mitigation


Since the `currentPeriod` is incremented when the auction starts, refer to the current auction by decrementing `currentPeriod`. Update the `transferReserveToAuction` function to access the correct auction address as follows:  

```solidity
(uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod - 1];
require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
```  

This ensures that the function correctly interacts with the last deployed auction contract.
