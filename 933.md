# The auction can never succeed

### Summary

When `Auction.endAuction()` is called and goes into success state branch, `transferReserveToAuction` in `Pool.sol` calls `require(msg.sender == auctionAddress)` check, which never satisfies, because `auctions[currentPeriod]` is always zero address. This happens because in `Pool.startAuction()` bond token's `currentPeriod` is incremented right after new auction is created.

### Root Cause

 In `Pool.startAuction()` bond token's `currentPeriod` is incremented right after new auction is created (when called `increaseIndexedAssetPeriod`). It refers to empty record in mapping.

### Impact

1. The auction algorithm doesn`t work, which leads to protocol insolvency.
2. The bidders funds can't be refunded or claimed, because the auction is never ended. This leads to forever frozen user funds
