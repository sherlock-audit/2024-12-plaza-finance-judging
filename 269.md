# Inconsistent use of safeTransfer vs. transfer in claimBid function

### Summary

The `claimBid` function directly calls `IERC20.transfer` instead of `SafeERC20.safeTransfer`, which can cause issues with ERC-20 tokens that do not revert on failure but instead return `false`. This inconsistency in using `safeTransfer` throughout the contract can lead to unhandled failures in token transfers.


### Root Cause

In the `claimBid` function:

```solidity
function claimBid(uint256 bidIndex) auctionExpired auctionSucceeded whenNotPaused external {
    Bid storage bidInfo = bids[bidIndex];
    if (bidInfo.bidder != msg.sender) revert NothingToClaim();
    if (bidInfo.claimed) revert AlreadyClaimed();

    bidInfo.claimed = true;
    IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
    emit BidClaimed(bidIndex, bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
}
```

The function calls `IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer(...)`, but some ERC-20 tokens do not revert on transfer failure; instead, they return `false`. If this happens, the function will not recognize the failure, leading to potential loss of funds or inconsistent contract states.

This issue does not exist in the `claimRefund` function, which correctly uses `SafeERC20.safeTransfer`:

```solidity
IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.sellCouponAmount);
```

### Impact

If the ERC-20 token used as `sellReserveToken` does not revert on failure but returns `false`, the `claimBid` function will continue executing as if the transfer was successful.
- This could result in users not receiving their funds while the contract marks their claim as processed.
- The inconsistency in transfer mechanisms can create potential security vulnerabilities if certain tokens behave unexpectedly.

### Mitigation

- Use `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` instead of `IERC20.transfer` to ensure the transfer operation is properly handled:

```solidity
IERC20(sellReserveToken).safeTransfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
```

- This ensures that the transaction properly reverts if the token transfer fails, maintaining consistency with other functions in the contract.
