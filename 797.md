# Protocol mechanics incorrectly assume 1 USDC will always be worth 1 USD

### Summary

The protocol mechanics assume 1 USDC == 1 USD. This is incorrect, and could lead to a loss of funds for users in case USDC depegs.

### Root Cause

Plaza is [designed to force bondETH to be worth 100 USDC](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/ab5bbd7d54042e4444b711a32def5b639fbd63b4/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L325). This is mentioned several times accross the documentation, and can also be seen in the mint/redeem calculations in the codebase, where `BOND_TARGET_PRICE` is set to 100 to force the 100 USDC price:

```solidity
// Pool.sol
function getCreateAmount(
        TokenType tokenType,
        uint256 depositAmount,
        uint256 bondSupply,
        uint256 levSupply,
        uint256 poolReserves,
        uint256 ethPrice,
        uint8 oracleDecimals
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
        ...

        // Compute collateral level, in PRECISION decimals
        uint256 collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / 
            (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE); 

```

We can also be sure that `BOND_TARGET_PRICE` refers to 100 USDC and not 100 USD, given that the protocol Auction system is designed to distribute the bonds in the form of USDC, and the total amount of coupons to distribute is computed by considering the current supply of bond tokens and a fixed amount of USDC (given by `sharesPerToken`) per bond token:

```solidity
// File: Pool.sol

function startAuction() external whenNotPaused {
        ...

        // Normalize bondETH supply
        uint256 normalizedTotalSupply = bondToken.totalSupply().normalizeAmount(
            bondDecimals,
            maxDecimals
        );
	
			 // Normalize shares (USDC) amount 
        uint256 normalizedShares = sharesPerToken.normalizeAmount(
            sharesDecimals,
            maxDecimals
        );

        // Calculate the coupon amount to distribute
        uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * 
            normalizedShares).toBaseUnit(
                maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals()
            );
       
       ...
	}
```

This makes it clear that the protocol aims at pricing bond tokens in USDC, and not in USD.

The problem is that this leads to Plaza incorrectly assuming that 1 USDC == 1 USD. When computing the amount of tokens to mint, the total TVL in the pool is computed in **USD, instead of USDC:**

```solidity
// File: Pool.sol

function simulateCreate(
        TokenType tokenType,
        uint256 depositAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        ...

        return
            getCreateAmount(
                tokenType,
                depositAmount,
                bondSupply,
                levSupply,
                poolReserves,
                getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD), // <---- !! The price for the reserve token is fetched in USD, not USDC
                getOracleDecimals(reserveToken, USD)
            ).normalizeAmount(COMMON_DECIMALS, assetDecimals);
    }
```

Then, in `getCreateAmount`, the TVL will be computed in USD, making the numerator in the `collateralLevel` calculation be in USD, but the denominator be in USDC:

```solidity
// File: Pool.sol

function getCreateAmount(
        TokenType tokenType,
        uint256 depositAmount,
        uint256 bondSupply,
        uint256 levSupply,
        uint256 poolReserves,
        uint256 ethPrice,
        uint8 oracleDecimals
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
       ...
        uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);

        uint256 collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / 
            (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE); 

				...
				
		}
```

This can lead to an incorrect computation of the pool’s current collateral level in case USDC depegs, effectively leading to a loss of funds.

### Attack Path

Considering the following scenario:

- The current `poolReserves` is 100 WETH.
- The `ethPrice` reported by the oracle is $3000.
- The `bondSupply` is 28.

In normal conditions (USDC is at peg with USD), the collateral level would be below the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, and the mint/redeem computations for bond and leverage tokens should be done considering the case where `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD` < 1.2:

- `TVL` = 100 WETH * 3000 = $300000
- `bondExpectedValuation` = 28 * `BOND_TARGET_PRICE` = $2800
- `collateralLevel` **≈** `TVL` / `bondExpectedValuation` **≈** 107.14, which is **below** the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`.

However, in case USDC depegs, say to $0.90 per USDC, the real TVL and collateral levels should be:

- `TVL` = 100 WETH * 3000 = $300000
- bond expected valuation = 23 * `BOND_TARGET_PRICE` * 0,90 = $**2070**

`collateralLevel` **≈** `TVL` / `bondExpectedValuation` **≈ 144,** which is above the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`.

> Note: USDC hit an all-time low to around $0.88 USD per USDC, more details [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/explaining-the-silicon-valley-bank-fallout-and-usdc-de-peg).

### Impact

As demonstrated in the attack path, incorrectly considering that 1 USDC is always worth 1 USD could break the minting/redeeming expected mechanics, as the collateral level computations will be incorrect, effectively breaking the expected behavior of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding an oracle to convert the `bondExpectedValuation` to USD.

Another way to mitigate this issue is by computing the `TVL` in USDC, instead of USD. This would need changes in `getOraclePrice` function in the `OracleReader`, as an additional step should be included to convert from USD to USDC.
