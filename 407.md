# Calling the transferReserveToAuction will revert due to increase in currentPeriod

### Summary

The auction contract calls the  [transferReserveToAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L577)  function to pull the reserve tokens.

However, an issue occur that will prevent the auction contract from calling the function.

### Root Cause

During auction creation, the `currentPeriod` is used to store the auction address in the `auctions` mapping, however, the `currentPeriod` is then [increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L567) to another value, meaning when we quote the current period again, it will return 2 if it was 1 prior to the incraese

```solidity

  552:@>    auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
        address(new Auction()),
        abi.encodeWithSelector(
          Auction.initialize.selector,
          address(couponToken),
          address(reserveToken),
          couponAmountToDistribute,
          block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
          1000,
          address(this),
          poolSaleLimit
        )
      );

      // Increase the bond token period
  @>    bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Can happen in normal operation.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User or anyone starts the [auction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530) and the auction address is stored in the `auctions` mapping
2. After some time, the auction succeed and the [transferReserveToAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L345) is called to transfer the reserve token to the auction contract.
3. Since the `currentPeriod` has now increased , quoting the `bondToken.globalPool()` will return the increased value, meaning the mapping will return zero address because there's no address saved to it, so comparing it with the `msg.sender` will revert because the  caller auctionaddress != address(0)

### Impact

The call to the `transferReserveToAuction` will fail and ending the auction will not take place.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

This can be mitigated by subtracting 1 from the quoted `currentPeriod` in the [transferReserveToAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L578)

```solidity
  function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
       (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
+     uint256  previousCurrentPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
      address auctionAddress = auctions[previousCurrentPeriod ];
      require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
      IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```

just like it happened in the [distribute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589) function.
