# Blocklisted bidder can force auction to fail

### Summary

During removal of excess bids, contract sends coupon tokens (USDC) to the lowest bidder. If the lowest bidder is blacklisted for USDC, all new bids will always revert and auction will become undersold.



### Root Cause

During removal of excess bids, contract sends coupon tokens (USDC) to the lowest bidder. If the lowest bidder is blacklisted for USDC, all new bids will always revert and auction will become undersold.

```solidity
        // Remove the bid
        _removeBid(currentIndex);

        // Move to the previous bid (higher price)
        currentIndex = prevIndex;
      } else {
        // Calculate the proportion of sellAmount being removed
        uint256 proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount;
        
        // Reduce the current bid's amounts
        currentBid.sellCouponAmount = sellCouponAmount - amountToRemove;
        currentCouponAmount -= amountToRemove;

        uint256 reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18);
        currentBid.buyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount - reserveReduction;
        totalSellReserveAmount -= reserveReduction;
        
        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

Refunding USDC to lowest bidder should happen during last bids. It can happen, for example, if `totalBuyCouponAmount` != `slotSize() * maxBids`:
```solidity
function removeExcessBids() internal {
    if (currentCouponAmount <= totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      return;
    }
```
Because `currentCouponAmount` % `slotSize()` = 0:
`totalBuyCouponAmount` = 1000e6 + 1 wei
`slotSize()` = `totalBuyCouponAmount / maxBids` = 1e6
`slotSize() * maxBids` = 1000e6

Also lowest bid should be blocklisted for USDC - it can happen naturally or attacker can abuse this by placing lowest bid right before `currentCouponAmount` > `totalBuyCouponAmount`.

### Mitigation

It's recommended to allow user to pull USDC rather than push to him.
