# Auction will be DOSed if a low bidder is blacklisted

### Summary

According to the README, auctions last for 10 days. If, by that time, the full amount hasn't been bought, the auction is failed, and users can claim their funds.

If a user places a very low bid, such that it needs to be removed in order to satisfy the auction, and then that user is blacklisted (USDC), the refund of their bid will revert, preventing the low bid's removal. 

### Root Cause

The removal of a low bid involves sending tokens directly back to the [original bidder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L285-L286):
```solidity
        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The auction for the reserves has just started

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. User makes a low bid of significant size
2. The user gets blacklisted by the USDC contract, which the README says is one of the tokens to be used
3. The user gets angry that their funds are stuck and decides to enter many large bids using different non-blocked wallets, to make the auction fail for everyone else who is waiting


### Impact

All other bidders are DOSed for >7 days, waiting for the auction to fail, at which point they can claim their bids (as can the blacklisted user's other wallets)

### PoC

-

### Mitigation

Make sending back of the bid tokens a pull operation
