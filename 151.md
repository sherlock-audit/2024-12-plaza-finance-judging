# Auction Settlement Fails Due to Incorrect Period Index Management

### Summary

A difference in the currentPeriod index between startAuction and transferReserveToAuction in Pool.sol will cause funds to remain locked for users, as the require condition in transferReserveToAuction fails, preventing auction settlement. This makes the functions claimBid and claimRefund uncallable auctionSucceeded since we can't change the status of the modifiers auctionSucceeded auctionFailed will not allow these functions to be called and user funds remain blocked.

### Root Cause

In `Pool.sol: 538`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L538 - the current period index is fetched as currentPeriod.

In `Pool.sol: 567`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L567 - just after creating an auction

In `BondToken.sol: 225`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L225 - This increments the globalPool.currentPeriod

In `Auction.sol: 345`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L345 - call to the Pool.transferReserveToAuction from the endAuction().

In `Pool.sol: 578-579`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L578 - The currentPeriod is now incremented (e.g., i+1 instead of i), causing the require statement to fail because auctions[i+1] does not correspond to the original auction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.	startAuction() increments the currentPeriod -> currentPeriod+1 after the creation auction at **auctions[currentPeriod]**  via bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod.
2. 	The transferReserveToAuction function retrieves the incremented currentPeriod and trying to verify **auctions[currentPeriod+1]**, which no longer matches the auctionâ€™s original period.



### External Pre-conditions

1.	Auctions depend on proper synchronization of the currentPeriod between Pool and BondToken.
2.	The auction settlement logic assumes currentPeriod remains consistent between startAuction and endAuction.


### Attack Path

1.	A user initiates an auction with startAuction.
2.	The currentPeriod increments after the starting of the auction.
3.	When attempting to settle the auction with endAuction, transferReserveToAuction fails due to mismatched currentPeriod.
4.	The auction cannot finalize, and funds remain locked indefinitely.

So we cannot make a transfer of funds for the auction and change its status. This makes the functions claimBid and claimRefund uncallable auctionSucceeded auctionFailed since these modifiers will not allow these functions to be called and user funds remain blocked.

### Impact

The users and the protocol suffers from locked funds and inability to settle auctions, rendering the auction system inoperable and harming user trust.

### Mitigation

Explicitly pass the currentPeriod to transferReserveToAuction when starting the auction:
uint256 auctionPeriod = currentPeriod;
auctions[auctionPeriod] = msg.sender;

Or creating Auction for auctions[currentPeriod+1] in startAuction() in the Pool.sol
