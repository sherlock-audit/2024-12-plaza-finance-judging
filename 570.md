# `joinBalancerPool` potencial balance return calculation issue

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L89


### summary
The joinBalancerPool function involves a user depositing assets into a Balancer pool and receiving balancerPoolToken in return. However, if another user is simultaneously exiting the pool, the liquidity of the pool changes, which can affect the amount of balancerPoolToken the joining user receives. The issue arises because the balance calculation for the amount of tokens to be issued to the joining user does not account for these dynamic changes in the pool liquidity during the transaction.

### Root Cause
The root cause of this issue is the fact that the pool liquidity can change between the time the `balancerPoolToken `balance is checked before the join and after the join operation.

Specifically:

- The function checks the `balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore` ( the pool’s token balance before the join).
- It then performs the `joinPool` operation, but if another user is simultaneously exiting the pool, the liquidity changes.
- Finally, the balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter is checked after the join operation, and the amount of tokens returned is calculated based on the difference between the two balances.

However, if liquidity changes during this process (because of an exit), the amount of balancerPoolToken returned to the joining user may not match their expected amount based on the pool’s state when they initiated the join.

```javascript
 function joinBalancerPool(
     ...
        // Join Balancer pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this)); 
1. lets saying balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore = 500

        balancerVault.joinPool(poolId, address(this), address(this), request);  // 2. Joins with 200  3. someone exits the pool (taking 100 )
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this)); 
    4. balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter = 500 + 200 - 100 = 600
        

        return balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter - balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore; 
        5. 600 - 500 = 100
        // but this user deposited 200
```

### Impact
This imbalance could result in a loss of value for the joining user since they are effectively receiving fewer tokens than they should, given their deposit.
