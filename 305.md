# Bidding can be DOSed

### Summary

A DOS can be cause by using USDC as the `coupon Token`.

### Root Cause

The [removeExcessBids](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L161) gets called here to remove and refund `out of range bids`, but this way of returning the token is a bit problematic, this is because the `current.bidder` 's address can be blaclisted for transfer, making the next biddings to be DOS.



```solidity
Auction.sol
281:        uint256 reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18);
282:        currentBid.buyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount - reserveReduction;
283:       totalSellReserveAmount -= reserveReduction;
284:        
285:        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
286:        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
```

The same issue  applies to [_removeBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L325) where it gets [called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L157) to remove excess bids when they exceed the `maxBids`.

```solidity
Auction.sol
318:    address bidder = bidToRemove.bidder;
319:    uint256 buyReserveAmount = bidToRemove.buyReserveAmount;
320:    uint256 sellCouponAmount = bidToRemove.sellCouponAmount;
321:    currentCouponAmount -= sellCouponAmount;
322:    totalSellReserveAmount -= buyReserveAmount;

324:    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
325:    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Use submits a bid
2. His address gets blacklisted
3. Now the remove and return would be DOS due to the blaclisting and thus DOS the bid from taking place

### Impact

Bidding would be DOS due to the blacklisting.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix is a bit non-trvia, but one approach would be to used try-catch to make sure that the address is not blackListed, and if it is then remove it and then move to the next bidder.
