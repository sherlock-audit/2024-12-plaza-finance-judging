# Unchecked Transfer Vulnerability in claimBid Function of Auction Contract

Summary
The `Auction.claimBid` function does not check the return value of the `IERC20.transfer` function, which can lead to a failed transfer without the transaction reverting, and potentially result in loss of funds for the auction contract.

Vulnerability Detail
The `claimBid` function in `Auction.sol` transfers `buyReserveAmount` of `sellReserveToken` to the bidder. This transfer is done using the `IERC20.transfer` function, but the return value of this transfer is ignored. If the transfer fails for any reason (e.g., insufficient balance of the auction contract, the target account not existing, or the ERC20 contract having a flawed `transfer` implementation), the `transfer` function will return `false` and the transaction will not revert, the execution will continue with a flawed state. The auction contract will believe it has transferred the tokens, even though it has not. This can create an inconsistency in accounting and potentially lead to loss of funds.

Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is high. If the token transfer fails and the transaction does not revert, the auction contract will have inconsistencies in its accounting, which might lead to financial loss, incorrect distribution of tokens to users, and other unpredictable behaviors. If the bid is deemed claimed, but the token transfer fails, the bidder will not receive the tokens that it has claimed. This will violate the principle of least surprise and make users loose trust in the protocol.

Manual Review

Recommendation
Modify the `claimBid` function to check the return value of the `IERC20.transfer` function. If the transfer fails (returns `false`), the transaction must revert. This can be done by using `require` or `revert`.

Here's how the modified code should look:
```solidity
    function claimBid(uint256 _bidId) external override whenNotPaused {
        BidInfo memory bidInfo = bids[_bidId];
        require(bidInfo.bidder != address(0), "bid not found");
        require(msg.sender == bidInfo.bidder, "not bidder");
        require(block.timestamp > bidInfo.endTime, "auction not ended");
        require(!bidInfo.claimed, "bid claimed");
        bidInfo.claimed = true;

        bids[_bidId] = bidInfo;
        
        // send the sellReserveToken to the bidder
        bool success = IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
        require(success, "transfer failed");

        emit BidClaimed(_bidId,bidInfo.bidder);
    }
```
