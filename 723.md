# User can always inflate the `totalSellReserveAmount` variable to block the auction from being ended

### Summary

User can always inflate the [`totalSellReserveAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L151) variable to block the auction from being ended. This is an extremely and cheap attack to perform because the user practically loses nothing. He can call the [`Auction::bid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125) function right before the end of the auction with some enormous `buyReserveAmount` as input. This will brick the money flow because he can do it over and over again for every auction, resulting in unprofitable investments for the people who hold `bondETH`


### Root Cause

`totalSellReserveAmount` being easily inflatable without any checks to prevent it 

### Internal Pre-conditions

User making a valid bid with enormous `buyReserveAmount` as input, right before the end of the auction

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User waits until for example 1 second before the end of the auction
2. Then he calls the bid function, making a valid bid with big `buyReserveAmount` input

With this the attack is already performed. After this happens and someone call the `Auction::endAuction` function, the auction will be in `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` state because of this check:
```solidity
        } else if (
            totalSellReserveAmount >=
            (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100
        ) 
```

### Impact

The money flow can be bricked and a user can purposefully bring every auction to `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` for no cost at all, since he can just call the `Auction::claimRefund` function afterwords 

### PoC

None
