# Attacker can force-update shares for anyone and prevent claiming coupouns

### Summary

Attacker can force-update `userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares` for any user by transfering dust amounts of `BOND` tokens to them, thus any future balance changes will not have any affect. Attacker can perform the attack when victims balance is zero, and `indexedAmountShares` will also be zero for current period too.


### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L194-L196)

Protocol design is to determine how much coupons users can claim based on their current `BOND` balance. But any user can force-update `userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares` for any user by transfering dust amounts of `BOND` tokens to them, thus any future balance changes will not have any affect:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }
```
And because `lastUpdatedPeriod` was updated and the for-loop is skipped, victim can claim 0 coupons, even if he/she has `BOND` in current distribution period.

### Attack Path

1. Bob wants to buy 100 `BOND` and claim 250 coupons in current distribution;
2. Amelie transfers 1 wei of bond token to Bob, shares for Bob = 2.5 `USDC` (assume shares per token = 2.5);
```solidity
for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }
```
3. Bob after buying 100 `BOND` expects to claim 250 coupons in current distribution, but can claim only 2.5 coupons.


### Impact

Attacker can force-update shares for anyone and prevent claiming coupouns.

_No response_

### Mitigation

It's recommended to update `indexedAmountShares` during claiming, even if it was updated in the same period before, because user's balance may be changed.
