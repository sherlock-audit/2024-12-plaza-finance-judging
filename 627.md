# potential risk of the storage overflowing in bondToken

### Summary

In the `bondToken` contract, holders' information is recorded in `userAssets` to calculate the number of coupon token shares for each holder. However, there are no restrictions on `userAssets`, which means the storage capacity could potentially approach infinity.

### Root Cause

If an individual holds bond tokens and passes through at least one period, they can receive coupon tokens proportional to the amount of bond tokens they hold. This is possible for all users. In the [BondToken.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L172C3-L180C4) contract, user information is recorded in `userAssets` if they have held bond tokens at least once:

```solidity
function updateIndexedUserAssets(address user, uint256 balance) internal {
    ...
    userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares = shares;
    userAssets[user].lastUpdatedPeriod = period;
    ...
}
```

This means that if a single bond token passes through the hands of 1,000,000 users, information for all of those users will be recorded. I am referencing just one bond token; an increase in the number of bond token holders will lead to a rapid increase in the number of storage slots used. The issue arises from the lack of restrictions on `userAssets`, which can lead to this problem occurring naturally as more users engage with the system.
