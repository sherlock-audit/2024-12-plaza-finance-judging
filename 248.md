# Reserve Cap Manipulation Leading to Claim Exploitation in `PreDeposit.sol`

### Summary

A vulnerability in the `PreDeposit` smart contract is identified where an attacker can manipulate the `reserveAmount` during the deposit period to gain an unfair advantage. By depositing the minimum amount through one address and filling or exceeding `reserveCap` with another address,  and withdrawing significant funds via this address just before the deposit period ends, the attacker can disproportionately claim a large share of tokens (bond and leverage) using the smaller deposit.



### Root Cause

The `reserveAmount` is used as the denominator for calculating `bond` and `leverage` token shares. However, the value of `reserveAmount` can be artificially reduced during the deposit period by exploiting the unrestricted withdrawal feature. This creates a situation where:

* The pool is created with a disproportionately small reserve amount.

* The claim function assigns nearly all bond and leverage tokens to an attacker due to the small `reserveAmount`.

In the `createPool` function in `PreDeposit.sol`, the function calls the `createPool` function of the factory contract. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L149-L158

```Solidity
  function createPool() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (reserveAmount == 0) revert NoReserveAmount();
    if (bondAmount == 0 || leverageAmount == 0) revert InvalidBondOrLeverageAmount();
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
    IERC20(params.reserveToken).approve(address(factory), reserveAmount);
    pool = factory.createPool(params, reserveAmount, bondAmount, leverageAmount, bondName, bondSymbol, leverageName, leverageSymbol, true);

    emit PoolCreated(pool);
    poolCreated = true;
  }
```


In the `createPool` function of `PoolFactory.sol` there are these checks which enable the creation of a pool with no minimum `reseveAmount`:  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PoolFactory.sol#L124

```Solidity
    if (reserveAmount == 0) {
      revert ZeroReserveAmount();  //@audit no min. reserveAmount
    }

    if (bondAmount == 0) {
      revert ZeroDebtAmount();
    }

    if (leverageAmount == 0) {
      revert ZeroLeverageAmount();
    }
```

So, a pool can be created with minimal `reserveAmount` by an attacker.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker uses two addresses: 0x123 (small deposit) and 0x789 (large deposit).

2. Deposit period:

    * 0x123 deposits a minimum amount.

    * 0x789 deposits up to the reserve cap.
  
3. Just before the deposit period ends:

    * 0x789 withdraws all funds, artificially lowering reserveAmount.

4. After the deposit period ends:

    * Attacker calls createPool() and uses 0x123 to exploit the claim calculation, receiving all bond and leverage tokens.

### Impact

* `Token Distribution Manipulation`: An attacker can unfairly claim all `bond` and `leverage` tokens, depriving legitimate participants of their rightful shares.

* `Protocol Reputation Risk`: The exploit can harm the reputation of the project, discouraging future participation.

### PoC

Setup: Assume the following:

* `reserveCap` = 10,000 tokens.

* `bondAmount` = 1,000 tokens, and `leverageAmount` = 1,000 tokens.

Attacker Action:

* Address 0x123 deposits 1 token.

* Address 0x789 deposits 9,999 tokens, filling up the reserve cap.

Withdrawal Before End Period:

* Just before the deposit period ends, 0x789 withdraws the entire 9,999 tokens, leaving `reserveAmount` = 1 token in the contract.

Pool Creation:

* The pool is created using the `createPool()` function, where:

  * `bondAmount` = 1,000 tokens.

  * `leverageAmount` = 1,000 tokens.

  * `reserveAmount` = 1 token.

Claim Exploitation:

* Address 0x123 calls claim(). Bond and leverage token shares are calculated as:

```Solidity
userBondShare = (1,000 * 1) / 1 = 1,000 tokens;
userLeverageShare = (1,000 * 1) / 1 = 1,000 tokens.
```

* Result: 0x123 receives all bond and leverage tokens, bypassing fair distribution.

### Mitigation

Enforce a Minimum Reserve Threshold:

Require that reserveAmount meets a minimum threshold (e.g., `80% of reserveCap`) for pool creation. Reject pool creation if the reserve falls below this threshold.
