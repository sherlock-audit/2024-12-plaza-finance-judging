# Auctions can end at prices that are significantly different from the market price.

### Summary

Current implementation of the auction contract lacks an absolute limit on the number of `reserveToken` (`sellReserveToken`) that can be exchanged. While a relative restriction exists to prevent the sale of more than 90% of the pool's reserve tokens, it does not account for the relationship between the market price and the reserve-to-coupon exchange ratio. 
This flaw allows attackers or free-market participants to manipulate or exploit the auction mechanics, leading to significant losses for the protocol..

### Root Cause

The contract only enforces a relative cap ([poolSaleLimit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341)), which is based on the pool's total reserve token balance. However, this cap does not ensure that the exchanged `reserveToken`s are close to the current market price.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

The amount of reserve tokens required in the auction is much greater than the amount of coupon tokens.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Without a maximum limit on the amount of `reserveToken` exchanged, the protocol is exposed to excessive selling during auction execution.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Absolute cap on `reserveToken` at the start of auction**:
   - Introduce a maximum limit for the reserve tokens that can be sold in an auction, based on current market conditions and allowable slippage, when auction starts.  
     ```solidity
     uint256 sellReserveAmountCap;
     function initialize(
         ...,
         uint256 _sellReserveAmountCap
     ) external initializer {
         sellReserveAmountCap = _sellReserveAmountCap;
         ...
     }
     ```
   - During auction settlement, enforce this cap:
     ```solidity
     if (totalSellReserveAmount > sellReserveAmountCap) {
         state = State.FAILED_MAX_SALE_LIMIT;
     }
     ```
2. **Dynamic pricing with slippage at the end of auction**:
   - Use external price oracles to validate the reserve-to-coupon exchange rate.
   - Enforce slippage limits:
     ```solidity
     uint256 oracleRate = sellReserveTokenPrice * 1e18 / buyCouponTokenPrice;
     uint256 auctionRate = totalSellReserveAmount * 1e18 / totalBuyCouponAmount;
     require(
         auctionRate <= oracleRate * (1e18 + maxSlippage) / 1e18,
         "Auction rate exceeds allowed slippage"
     );
     ```
