# Address with `SECURITY_ROLE` will get unintended authorizations in `PreDeposit`

## Summary

Address with `SECURITY_ROLE` gets unauthorized accesss to set parameters in `PreDeposit`.

## Vulnerability Details

In multiple instances throughout the protocol, e.g. `Distributor`, `Pool`, `BondToken`, `LeverageToken` and `Auction`, only the address with the `SECURITY_ROLE` should be the one pausing the contracts.

In the `README`, it stated that the address with this role should only be trusted to pause/unpause contracts.

> SECURITY_COUNCIL_ROLE should only be trusted to pause/unpause contracts.

In the `PreDeposit` contract, only the owner can pause it because of the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means that the address with the `SECURITY_ROLE` must also be the owner to pause the contract. As a result, that address will have complete access to all functions that only the owner can use.

This goes against the fact that the address with the `SECURITY_ROLE` should only be trusted to pause/unpause contracts.

## Impact

Address with `SECURITY_ROLE` gets unathorized access to contract functionality

## Mitigation

Add the relevant `onlyRole` modifier to the contract to check that only the address with the `SECURITY_ROLE` should be able to pause the PreDeposit contract
