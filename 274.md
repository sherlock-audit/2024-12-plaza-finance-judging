# Auction.bid() wont work after the first bid.

### Summary

`nextBidIndex` will be 0 for first bid which will be made the `highestBidIndex`

### Root Cause

`currentBid.nextBidIndex` will be 0 for the first bid which is made the `highestBidIndex`, making the below while loop become an infinite loop that will DOS `bid()`
```solidity
   } else {
      uint256 currentBidIndex = highestBidIndex;
      uint256 previousBidIndex = 0;

      // Traverse the linked list to find the correct spot for the new bid
      while (currentBidIndex != 0) {//@audit-issue becomes infinite loop.
        // Cache the current bid's data into local variables
```

The First bid is made the highest bid by default

```solidity
 function insertSortedBid(uint256 newBidIndex) internal {
    Bid storage newBid = bids[newBidIndex];
    uint256 newSellCouponAmount = newBid.sellCouponAmount;
    uint256 newBuyReserveAmount = newBid.buyReserveAmount;
    uint256 leftSide;
    uint256 rightSide;

    if (highestBidIndex == 0) {//@audit-here
      // First bid being inserted
      highestBidIndex = newBidIndex;
      lowestBidIndex = newBidIndex;
    } else {

```
The next bid after the first bid will always revert due to infinite loop. The infinite loop will be as a result of the first bid's `nextBidIndex` being 0

```solidity
   Bid memory newBid = Bid({
      bidder: msg.sender,
      buyReserveAmount: buyReserveAmount,
      sellCouponAmount: sellCouponAmount,
      nextBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the end of the list
      prevBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the start of the list
      claimed: false
    });

``` 

since the bid was the first bid, it was made the `highestBidIndex` with 0 as `nextBidIndex`
```solidity
  function insertSortedBid(uint256 newBidIndex) internal {
    Bid storage newBid = bids[newBidIndex];
    uint256 newSellCouponAmount = newBid.sellCouponAmount;
    uint256 newBuyReserveAmount = newBid.buyReserveAmount;
    uint256 leftSide;
    uint256 rightSide;

    if (highestBidIndex == 0) {
      // First bid being inserted
      highestBidIndex = newBidIndex;
      lowestBidIndex = newBidIndex;
    } else {
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

`Auction.bid()` wont work after the first bid.

There will be reverts caused by infinite loop.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

maybe set `nextBidIndex` as 1 by default instead of 0
