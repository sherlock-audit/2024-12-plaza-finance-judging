# Auction can be forced to FAIL.

### Summary

The auction status in `Auction.sol` can be forced to be in `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` which might break protocol global behavior.

**Note**: if this is a valid issue, please don't report it under my github handler, but with my Watson name **Hurley** or **0xHurley**!

### Root Cause

**Note**: This is a logical/business issue rather than a code issue.

- In `Auction.sol:341` the auction status is set to `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` if the `totalSellReserveAmount` is greater pool reserveToken balance (adjusted with a %).

- If just before the end of the auction, if an attacker place a bid, buying a lot of reserveToken for a good price (doesn't need to be the best price on the bid list), then the auction can fail.
- And at the end, the attacker can claim back 100% of his funds with `claimRefund()`. 
- Because it is free to do for the attacker and the attacker is sure to take back his money, attacker can block Auction process for free.

This doesn't bring any value to the attacker, but block completely the Auction process and thus, the whole protocol.

This doesn't work everytime, it's more likely to happen when `totalBuyCouponAmount` is close from `reserveToken.balanceOf(pool)` in $ value.

### Attack Path

1. Setup
  a. 3500 $ / ETH
  b. 300 ETH in the pool
  c. poolSaleLimit = 100
  d. totalBuyCouponAmount = 1_000_000 $
  e. totalSellReserveAmount = 285 ETH
  f. In this situation the auction will succeed (avg. 3508 $/ ETH).
2. The attacker bid with buyReserveAmount: 20 ETH, sellCouponAmount: 900_000$ (45000 $ / ETH!) 
3. The bid is sure to be on top of the list (pushing one bid out of the successful bidder section, but neglected here, for simplicity of calculation).
4. The auction end and `totalSellReserveAmount approx = 305 ETH` > `300 ETH` in the pool
5. Attacker claim back his 900_000$. 
6. Auction is cancelled. 

### Impact

This can lead to a DOS of the Auction, which might break the protocol behavior on the long run.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

During the creation of a bid, instead of checking that the buyReserveAmount is not more than an arbitrary `MAX_BID_AMOUNT`, use the pool limit inside of it, or within the removeExcessBids function, add the a logic similar than the one with coupon amount, with the `totalSellReserveAmountthat` should not exceed the limit given by the pool ( `(IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100)` )
