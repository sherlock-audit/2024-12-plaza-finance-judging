# The protocol's auction system does not work when `bondToken` has less than 9 decimals

### Summary

In `startAuction` function of `Pool` contract, it applies conversion of token decimals for coupon token. However, the decimals calculation here is not correctly handled, and as a result, the function reverts when the `bondToken` has decimals less than 9.

### Root Cause

On the line [Pool.sol#L550](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L550), it calculates the decimals to remove by `maxDecimals * 2 - couponTokenDecimals`, which could be negative.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Decimals of `bondToken` is set to less than 9.
- Decimals of coupon token is greater than `2 * bondTokenDecimals`, e.g., `DAI` token can be used as coupon token, which has 18 decimals.

### External Pre-conditions

Anyone triggers `startAuction`.

### Attack Path

- The decimals of `bondToken` is set to 6, for example.
- `DAI` token is set as reserve token.
- When `startAuction` is called by anyone and it reverts.

### Impact

The `startAuction` function which is the core protocol functionality does not work.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Rather than using `toBaseUnit`, it should convert the decimals using `normalizeAmount`.

```diff
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)
-       .toBaseUnit(maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
+       .normalizeAmount(maxDecimals * 2, IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
```
