# BondETH redemption will revert with underflow if TVL is less than redemption value

### Summary

The formula of the collateral level calculation involves subtraction `tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)` and may cause an arithmetic underflow when TVL is less than `depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE`.

### Root Cause

In `Pool.sol:498` the numerator in the collateral level calculation formula is calculated as `tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)` where `depositAmount` is the amount of bondETH a user wants to redeem:

However, it is possible for `depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE` to exceed the TVL, as TVL depends solely on the ETH price, which can fluctuate significantly. A sharp drop in the ETH price, causing a bank-run situation where bondETH holders rush to exit, could shrink the TVL and eventually prevent bondETH holders from redeeming their tokens. The contract must still allow those users to redeem tokens using the `marketRate` if redemption is permitted.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

1. ETH price falls significantly, causing a drop in TVL i.e. making collateral level less than 1.0

### Attack Path
Let's assume the pool with `10` wstETH in reserves and outstanding bondETH being `333`. wstETH oracle price is `$4000`

`outstandingDebt = bondSupply * 100 = 33000`
`TVL = 10 * 4000 = 40000`
`collateralLevel = 10 * 4000 / (333 * 100) = 1.2012`

This collateral level reflects a perfectly possible state of the protocol because it almost equals the threshold value (1.2) the protocol uses to define derivatives pricing. Therefore bondETH and reserves supply make sense as well given that wstETH price of `$4000` is close to a real market price at the time of writing.

Suppose, due to a market downturn, the price of wstETH falls to `$3200` (`-20%`).

`TVL = 32000`
`collateralLevel = 10 * 3200 / (100 * 333) = 0.96`

Since TVL is now lower than outstanding debt, the calculation `tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)` will revert if depositAmount is > 320. 

### Impact

The bondETH holders may not be able to redeem the full amount of their bondETH tokens, meaning that redeem functionality is broken. The correct behavior must be to proceed with the execution to the branch that determines the result based on this documented logic:
> If the collateral level is less than 1.2, the redemption price of 1 bondETH is the lesser of 80% * the quantity of wstETH in the vault * the oracle price of wstETH / the quantity of bondETH outstanding and the oracle bondETH price on Aerodrome.
