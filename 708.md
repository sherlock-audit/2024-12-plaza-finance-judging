# Leverage token holders will suffer unredeemable reserves due to truncation in redeem rate calculation

### Summary

In `Pool.sol#L514` the premature division before multiplication in leverage token redemption formula will cause complete redemption failures for leverage token holders when collateralization is sufficient, as the protocol will compute zero redeem rate despite valid redemption capacity. 

### Root Cause

In [`Pool.sol#L514`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L514) the calculation `((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION` performs division before multiplication when collateralization is sufficient (collateralLevel > 120%), causing premature integer truncation:

```solidity
    // Calculate the redeem rate based on the collateral level and token type
    uint256 redeemRate;
    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
@>    redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
    } else {
      redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
    }
```

This leads to a redeem rate of zero whenever `(tvl - bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE) < assetSupply`, despite there being valid reserve backing for leverage token redemptions. The correct approach would multiply before dividing (`(adjustedValue * PRECISION) / assetSupply`) to preserve precision in fractional scenarios. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Pool collateralization level > 120% (triggering leverage token redemption logic)
2. `(tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)` yields positive value but smaller than `levSupply`

### External Pre-conditions

1. Oracle price feed for reserve token (e.g. ETH/USD) shows value that makes `tvl` marginally exceed `bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE`
2. Market conditions create TVL where `(tvl - bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)` is 0 < x < levSupply

### Attack Path

1. Pool State Initialization:
   - bondSupply = 1000 bonds ($100,000 debt at $100/bond)
   - levSupply = 21,000 LTokens
   - reserveToken = WETH (oracle price: $1,000/ETH)
   - reserveBalance = 120.1 ETH → $120,100 TVL
   - collateralLevel = ($120,100 * 1e6)/$100,000 = 1,201,000 (>1.2M threshold)

2. Leverage Holder Action:
   - Calls redeem(TokenType.LEVERAGE, 1 LToken, 0)
   - simulateRedeem() executes:
     a. Normalizes 1 LToken to COMMON_DECIMALS (18)
     b. Computes:
        adjustedValue = $120,100 - $100,000 = $20,100
				redeemRate = (20,100 / 21,000) = 0.957 → 0 (truncated) * 1e6 = 0
     c. Converts to reserveToken: (1 * 0)/1e6 = 0 ETH

3. Protocol Enforcement:
   ```solidity
   if (reserveAmount == 0) { // From simulateRedeem()
       revert ZeroAmount(); // Tx reverts at validation check
   ```

### Impact

• **Temporary Fund Lock**: While (adjustedValue < levSupply), ALL leverage redemptions revert despite protocol solvency
• **Oracle Dependency Risk**: Users cannot redeem until either:
   a) ETH price ↑ sufficiently to make adjustedValue ≥ levSupply, OR
   b) LToken supply ↓ via other means (unlikely without functioning redemptions)
• **Protocol Functionality Failure**: 
   - Violates Q&A assurance during vulnerable periods
   - Creates systemic risk of redemption deadlock during market dips
• **Value Destruction**: 
   - Example: $20,100 surplus inaccessible to LToken holders until market recovers
   - Users bear 100% loss risk during vulnerable periods

**Key Clarification**:  
The lock is not strictly permanent but persists *until market conditions change sufficiently*. However, this:  
1. Forces LToken holders to speculate on oracle prices for basic redemption rights  
2. Creates protocol instability during common market fluctuations  
3. Violates core redemption guarantees during vulnerable periods

### Mitigation

**Fix Integer Division Truncation:**  
Modify the leverage token redemption calculation to multiply before dividing:

```diff
- redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
+ redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / assetSupply;
```
