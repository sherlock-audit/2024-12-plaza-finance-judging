# Collateral Level Calculation in getCreateAmount() assumes all bonds were issued at 100 USDC

### Summary

Pool.sol incorrectly assumes that all bondETH were issued at 100 USDC (BOND_TARGET_PRICE constant). This has the effect of 
overstating the Pool's liabilities and can artificially show the pool as being undercollateralized.

### Root Cause

```solidity
 uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
    uint256 collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);//@audit Mistaken collateral level calc. Assumption of 100 Bond Price for ALL issued bonds. This will not always be the case.
    uint256 creationRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION; 

    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) { 
      if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }
      creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) { 
      if (assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }

      uint256 adjustedValue = tvl - (BOND_TARGET_PRICE * bondSupply);
      
      creationRate = (adjustedValue * PRECISION) / assetSupply;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A collateral level that falls from a healthy >1.2 to unhealthy < 1.2
2. Issuance of discounted bonds at this lower collateral level, as determined by [Pool.sol::Line 333](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L333)
3. Increase of collateral level above 1.2
4. Issuance of bonds and mistaken collateral level calculation at [Pool.sol::Line 326](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L326C1-L326C84)

### External Pre-conditions

1. Collateral level drops from above 1.2 to below 1.2
2. Bonds are issued at below 1.2 collateral level (discounted bonds are issued)
3. Collateral level rises above 1.2 again
4. Bonds are issued at the "healthy" collateral level. Protocol assumes that all bonds issued below the 1.2 collateral level were priced at 100 when in fact they were not. They were discounted.
5. Note that we assume the ethPrice remains the same...i.e. the pool is not undercollateralized by reduced value of its reserves.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

**1. The protocol overstates its own liabilities.** 
Specifically, it overstates the value of all bonds that were issued at a collateral level lower than 1.2. The more bonds that are issued at a lower collateral level, the bigger the problem becomes. It has the effect of distorting the collateral level moving into the future for all market participants and for the protocol itself. As shown by the PoC below, it can potentially become a large enough issue that the protocol believes it is undercollateralized when it is not (impact #2). This exacerbates the issue further leading to excessive discounted bond issuance (impact #3).
 
**2. Protocol can think it is undercollateralized when it is not**
See PoC below.

**3. Protocol issues excessive discounted bonds when it should not be**
This puts a further strain on the actual collateralization, leading to **_an actual undercollateralized situation_**. I.e. excessive discounted bond issuance lowers true collateral level. The impact of the mistaken collateral level calculation results in undercollateralization.

    assert(ProtocolCollateralLevelCalc3 < accurateCL); //assert protocol CL is understated
    assert(ProtocolCollateralLevelCalc3 < collateralThreshold); //assert protocol thinks it is under the threshold
  }
```

### Mitigation

Separately track the bonds issued below the healthy 100 level. Calculate collateral level with the value of all bonds issued in healthy state and all bonds issued in unhealthy state.
