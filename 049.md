# [H] Users can cross-exit Balancer pools.

### Summary

Missing checks and erroneous Balancer integrations in `BalancerRouter.joinBalancerAndPlaza()` and `BalancerRouter.exitPlazaAndBalancer()` allow users to leave a different `BalancerPool` than the one they initially registered in. 

This may result in loss of funds if leveraged by malicious actors.

### Root Cause

There are two significant issues in the code:

1. The `BalancerVault.joinPool()` parameters point to `address(this)`(i.e the `BalancerRouter` contract) as both sender and recipient. This leads to the accounting not being performed on a per-user basis, but rather as a "singleton"; essentially all `joinPool()` calls will have the `BalancerRouter` as the receiver of the `BalancerVault` shares.
2. There are no cross-checks that bind a specific "Plaza Pool" to the underlying `BalancerPoolId` that a user initially joined.

This flexibility in accounting, combined with the fact that a user can register a cheap "Plaza Pool" can be leveraged to exit into a more expensive position.


### Internal Pre-conditions

- Assumes other users have previously used the Router, so that liquidity accrues.

### External Pre-conditions

- None.

### Attack Path

1. Normal users use `joinPool()` as intended, liquidity accumulates across various `balancerPoolId`s. 
2. Malicious user calls `BalancerRouter.joinBalancerAndPlaza()` with the following parameters:
    - `balancerPoolId`: w/e. say, for example: `= 1999`
    - `_plazaPool`: whichever `PlazaPool` is the cheapest to join(whichever issues most tokens)
    - `assets`: w/e.
    - `maxAmountsIn`: w/e.
    - `userData`: w/e.
    - `plazaTokenType`: w/e.
    - `minPlazaTokens`: w/e.
    - `deadline`: w/e.
3. After analyzing the most profitable trade options, the malicious user calls `BalancerRouter.exitPlazaAndBalancer()` with the following parameters:
    - `balancerPoolId`: w/e. say, for example: `= 1` (most profitable)
    - `_plazaPool`: whichever `PlazaPool` user initially joined.
    - …

The call at `3` will go through, since the `BalancerRouter` stores all the positions into `BalancerVault`'s Pools to itself, rather than forwarding them to the initial depositors. 

Thus, the malicious user will be able to use the liquidity of a different `BalancerPoolId` that the one they joined. Additionally, since the malicious user initially joined a cheaper `PlazaPool`, they will maximize their returned `balancerPoolTokens` as per the calculation performed in at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L103-L106.

### Impact

The users might experience total loss of their positions, as they can no longer exit their initial BalancerPool.

### PoC

N/A due to lack of time and adequate existing testing suite.

### Mitigation

- Update the accounting when the `BalancerVault` pools are joined, so that instead of keeping all the shares to the `BalancerRouter`, they are instead forwarded to the users that actually made the deposits. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L86
- Normally, router contracts don’t have accounting; but if the aforementioned recommendation is not satisfactory, an alternative could be recommended: basically performing accounting on the `plazaPool` and `balancerPoolId` each users deposited for; then check this against when exits are performed.
