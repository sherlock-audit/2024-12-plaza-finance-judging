# BondToken::getIndexedUserAmount Decimals Issue

### Summary

The `BondToken::getIndexedUserAmount` function calculates the number of shares based on the current period and previous pool amounts. It is supposed to return the shares in `SHARES_DECIMALS` format, but it fails to achieve this.

### Root Cause

```solidity
  function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }
}
```

Given that balance is a number with 18 decimals, and the function divides by `SHARES_DECIMALS` (6 decimals), it is impossible for the function to return shares in the correct 6-decimal format. This discrepancy inflates the share amounts stored for users.

The function is eventually called during updates triggered by mints and transfers, resulting in inflated share values being stored for users.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users who have not withdrawn shares from previous periods would see an increase in their share amounts. As a result, they could withdraw more than they are entitled to by interacting with the Distributor, potentially leading to **insolvency** or a **denial-of-service (DoS)** in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Properly normalize the result and adjust all occurrences where the `getIndexedUserAmount` function is used to ensure consistent handling of decimals.
