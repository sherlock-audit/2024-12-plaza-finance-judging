# [M-02] Pool.sol:_create() and Pool.sol:_redeem() allows blaclisted addresses to mint, redeem, and receive reserve tokens

### Summary

The _create() and _redeem() functions in Pool contract do not enforce blacklist restrictions, allowing blacklisted users to:

1. Receive tokens via minting (if another user mints on their behalf).
2. Burn tokens to redeem reserves (no blacklist check on msg.sender during _redeem()).
3. Receive reserve tokens after redemption (no blacklist check on recipient during _redeem()).

- _create() does not check if recipient is blacklisted, allowing blacklisted users to receive newly minted tokens.
- _redeem() does not check if msg.sender is blacklisted, allowing blacklisted users to burn and redeem tokens.
- _redeem() does not check if recipient is blacklisted, allowing blacklisted users to receive reserve tokens after redemption.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker or blacklisted entity has an address that is already blacklisted.
2. A non-blacklisted user mints tokens on behalf of the blacklisted address (or the blacklisted address already holds tokens).
3. The protocol allows unrestricted token burning and reserve withdrawals.

### Attack Path

1. A non-blacklisted user (User A) mints tokens for a blacklisted recipient.
```solidity
_create(TokenType.BOND, 1000, 500, BlacklistedUser);
```
2. The blacklisted recipient successfully receives minted tokens.
3. The blacklisted recipient burns tokens to redeem reserve assets.
```solidity
_redeem(TokenType.BOND, 1000, 500, BlacklistedUser);
```
4. The protocol does not restrict blacklisted addresses from redeeming.
5. The blacklisted user successfully burns tokens and extracts liquidity.

### Impact

The protocol cannot prevent blacklisted addresses from withdrawing reserves, putting liquidity providers at risk.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Prevent minting, redeem and transfer to blacklisted addresses:

1. Modify _create() to check the recipient before minting:
```solidity
require(!blacklist[recipient], "Blacklisted address cannot receive tokens");
```

2. Modify _redeem() to check msg.sender before burning tokens:
```solidity
require(!blacklist[msg.sender], "Blacklisted address cannot redeem tokens");
```

3. Modify _redeem() to check recipient before transferring reserve assets:
```solidity
require(!blacklist[recipient], "Blacklisted recipient cannot receive reserves");
```
