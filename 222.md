# Precision Loss in `getRedeemAmount` function can cause miscalculation

### Summary

The `getRedeemAmount` function contains a calculation path for `LEVERAGE` token redemption where division is performed before multiplication. This ordering causes precision loss when handling large integers or values with significant decimal components, potentially leading to inaccuracies in the computed `redeemRate`. As a result, users redeeming LEVERAGE tokens may receive incorrect amounts of reserve tokens, which could be significantly lower or higher than the intended amount, creating risks of value distortion and operational inefficiencies.

### Root Cause

In the `getRedeemAmount` function, when `tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE`, the `redeemRate` is calculated as follows:

```solidity
redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
```

Here, the division between `(tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE))` and `assetSupply` occurs first, truncating decimal precision. The subsequent multiplication by `PRECISION` (1,000,000) cannot restore the lost precision, leading to cumulative inaccuracies.
