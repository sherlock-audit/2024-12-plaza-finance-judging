# Users can manipulate pool reserve balance to end auction in their favor

### Summary

The use of the pool contract reserve token balance during `endAuction` opens a possibility for users to manipulate the pool balance and force auction closure with the preferred outcome.

### Root Cause

In Auction.sol:341 there is a check of the pool balance of reserve token to not exceed `poolSaleLimit`:

Users can manipulate this condition by supplying or withdrawing a specific amount of reserve tokens according to their intent.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The auction ended with enough coupon tokens accumulated from bids.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The auction is at the end of the bidding period and has accumulated enough coupon tokens to end successfully
2. The levETH holder sees that the reserve token amount to be sent from the pool does not exceeds `poolSaleLimit` thus auction will succeed
3. The levETH holder redeems their levETH thus decreasing the reserve token balance to the level to not pass `poolSaleLimit`
4. The levETH holder calls `endAuction()` and the auction ends with the state `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`
5. The levETH holder buys back their levETH tokens

Note that a similar attack can be executed in the opposite direction by bondETH holders, if they see it being profitable, to make  `poolSaleLimit` check pass.

Incentives for the attack:
1. Holders of bondETH are incentivized to end auctions with `State.SUCCEEDED` otherwise they will not receive coupon payments
2. Holders of levETH are incentivized to end auctions with `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` to prevent coupon payments, as this decreases reserves and, thus, the levETH token price.

### Impact
1. `poolSaleLimit` can be bypassed jeopardizing the pool's financial health.
2. bondETH holders may not receive coupon payments while levETH holders unfairly benefit from holding reserves and levETH price unchanged.
3. levETH holders may incur losses due to reserves (and thus levETH price) falling below expectations while bondETH holders unfairly benefit from the forced coupon distribution. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

One possible mitigation could be to introduce a cooldown period for creation and redemption of bondETH and levETH.
