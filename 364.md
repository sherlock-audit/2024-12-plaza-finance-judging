# Balancer LP tokens can be lost under some conditions in `joinBalancerAndPredeposit`

### Summary

`BalancerRouter::joinBalancerAndPredeposit` enables users to join the balancer pool, then use the LP token as reserve token to pre-deposit into Plaza pool for bond/leverage tokens. However, under some conditions, part of the LP token will be stuck in contract, causing fund loss for users.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in [`Predeposit::_deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L118) function, as it handles the core logic of pre-depositing:
```solidity
  function _deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) private checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
    if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached();

    address recipient = onBehalfOf == address(0) ? msg.sender : onBehalfOf;

    // if user would like to put more than available in cap, fill the rest up to cap and add that to reserves
    if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
      amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
    }

    balances[recipient] += amount;
    reserveAmount += amount;

    IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    emit Deposited(recipient, amount);
  }
```

Here, we can notice there is a cap logic, which if the deposited amount exceeds the capped value, only part of the reserve tokens will be successfully deposited, and those will be transferred from `msg.sender` to `Predeposit` contract. However, if such deposit is done through `BalancerRouter`, then it would cause an issue:
```solidity
    function joinBalancerAndPredeposit(
        bytes32 balancerPoolId,
        address _predeposit,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        // Step 1: Join Balancer Pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = joinBalancerPool(balancerPoolId, assets, maxAmountsIn, userData);

        // Step 2: Approve balancerPoolToken for PreDeposit
        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(_predeposit, balancerPoolTokenReceived);

        // Step 3: Deposit to PreDeposit
        PreDeposit(_predeposit).deposit(balancerPoolTokenReceived, msg.sender);

        return balancerPoolTokenReceived;
    }
```

Here, we see user first joins the pool, the router would get LP token. The router then approves `Predeposit` contract for further transfer actions, but when only partial amount is deposited, the rest stays in the router contract, causing user to lose funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The cap for `Predeposit` contract is 100 wei
2. The current deposited amount is 80 wei
3. Alice sees there is 20 wei's space left, and decides to pre-deposit 20 wei.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Bob also sees the opportunity, but unlike Alice, he decides to pre-deposit 15 wei.
2. Bob's transaction goes through first, leaving the available deposit amount to be 5 wei.
3. Alice's deposit happens right after Bob's, and she only deposits 5 wei, the rest 15 wei will be stuck in the router contract.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

As described above, the excess LP tokens will be stuck in the router contract, causing loss of funds. While the chain to be deployed on is BASE, and frontrunning can rarely happen, but unintentional ones can still happen. In an unfortunate event, it could cause serious loss for users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an extra check in the router contract, when pre-deposit doesn't consume all LP tokens, transfer the rest to `msg.sender`.
