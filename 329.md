# `NotInAuction` not working as intended will allow gov admins to accidentally change settings during auction period

### Summary

When there is ongoing auction, gov admins will not be allowed to change pool settings such as distribution period, share per token, etc..
`NotInAuction` is the modifier which handles this duty.

The problem is that the logic inside `NotInAuction` is not implemented correctly, so it can't detect ongoing auction, always allowing gov admins to modify settings. 

### Root Cause

Whenever a new auction is started, current period of bond token will be increased by 1.

That means in order to check ongoing auction, we need to check in the previous period, not current period (`auctions[currentPeriod - 1]`). Fetching auction in `auctions[currentPeriod]` will always return 0, making the require check in line 752 always passes.

### Impact

Medium. Since admins can accidentally change pool settings when they are not allowed to.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider this fix:
```solidity
modifier NotInAuction() {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    if (Auction(auctions[currentPeriod] - 1).state() != Auction.State.BIDDING) revert;
    _;
  }
```
