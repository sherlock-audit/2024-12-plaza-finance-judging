# Users may be locked from claiming coupons for previous periods during the active auction

### Summary

When a new auction starts, the shares of coupons will be increased effectively making every bondETH holder to be eligible for coupons for one extra period for which the Distributor contract has not got any funds yet.


### Root Cause

When a new auction starts, the pool increases the indexing period making users eligible for one more distribution period right away:

This may lead to a situation when users start claiming coupons ***before the auction ends***. In such a case, they will be able to claim coupons for the period when the auction is still running. However, because the Distributor does not have funds to cover those extra costs yet, eventually it will run out of funds and will revert to new claim requests.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction is running

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice is bondETH holder, accumulated coupons (has not withdrawn them) for two past periods
2. Auction for 3rd period starts
3. Alice wants to withdraw coupons for 1st and 2nd periods and calls `claim()`
4. Transaction reverts because the distributor contract tries to withdraw coupons for 3 periods for Alice.
5. Result: Alice cannot withdraw until the auction ends

Note: this attack path example assumes Alice is the only bondholder. However, the same path will work in the case of any bond holders where some users can withdraw coupons but the rest of the users will be rejected once the distributor contract runs out of funds. 

### Impact

A prolonged DoS state - inability to withdraw coupons - for a part of users until the auction is finished (according to docs, typically 10 days) due to other users claiming coupons including the ongoing auctioned period.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not include coupons for the current period in claimable amounts if the auction has not finished.
