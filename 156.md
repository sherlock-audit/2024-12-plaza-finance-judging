# Unrestricted Access to startAuction and Period Misalignment Risks Blocking Auction Funds

### Summary

The lack of access control in the startAuction function and its direct update of currentPeriod in BondToken.sol can lead to misaligned period management. If startAuction is called prematurely, the currentPeriod is updated before the previous auction is finalized, causing transferReserveToAuction in Pool.sol to revert and block user funds.


### Root Cause

In `Pool.sol:530`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530 Anyone can call startAuction without validation other than block.timestamp.

In `Pool.sol:567`:  bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L567
startAuction calls bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken), incrementing globalPool.currentPeriod immediately.

In `Auction.sol:345`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L345 
In `Pool.sol:578`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L578

If someone calls again startAuction() than endAuction -> transferReserveToAuction in Pool.sol retrieves the updated currentPeriod and attempts to access a non-existent auction, causing a revert.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1.	startAuction can be called by anyone without validation.
2.	currentPeriod is updated in BondToken.sol before the previous auction’s settlement.


### External Pre-conditions

1.	An auction is running when another actor prematurely calls startAuction.


### Attack Path

1.	A user or attacker calls startAuction prematurely, updating the currentPeriod.
2.	The endAuction for the previous period is called but fails during transferReserveToAuction due to misaligned currentPeriod.
3.	Funds in the auction contract remain locked as endAuction cannot complete successfully.

### Impact

1.  The affected party (users and protocol) experiences blocked funds in the auction contract.
2. The protocol’s auction mechanism is disrupted, harming its reliability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Store currentPeriod in Auction.sol:
	1.	Add a period variable in Auction.sol to track the auction’s currentPeriod.
	2.	Pass this period to Pool.sol during endAuction to avoid relying on the dynamically updated currentPeriod in BondToken.sol.
