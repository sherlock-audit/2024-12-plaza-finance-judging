# Lack of Minimum Threshold for `buyReserveAmount` in `bid()` Function

### Summary


The `bid()` function within the `Auction` contract lacks a critical validation step for the `buyReserveAmount` parameter. While the function ensures that `buyReserveAmount` is greater than zero and below a predefined maximum (`MAX_BID_AMOUNT`), it does not enforce a **minimum threshold** for `buyReserveAmount`. This omission allows an attacker to place bids with exceedingly small `buyReserveAmount` values paired with large `sellCouponAmount` values. 


### Root Cause

### **Vulnerability Details**

The vulnerability resides in the `bid()` function of the `Auction.sol` contract. Specifically, the function does not enforce a **minimum threshold** for `buyReserveAmount`, allowing bids with negligible reserve amounts that can disrupt the auction's integrity.

**Affected Code Snippet:**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125-L171

```solidity
  function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns(uint256) {
    if (sellCouponAmount == 0 || sellCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (buyReserveAmount == 0) revert BidAmountTooLow();
    if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh();


    // Transfer buy tokens to contract
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sellCouponAmount);


    Bid memory newBid = Bid({
      bidder: msg.sender,
      buyReserveAmount: buyReserveAmount,
      sellCouponAmount: sellCouponAmount,
      nextBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the end of the list
      prevBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the start of the list
      claimed: false
    });


    lastBidIndex++; // Avoids 0 index
    uint256 newBidIndex = lastBidIndex;
    bids[newBidIndex] = newBid;
    bidCount++;


    // Insert the new bid into the sorted linked list
    insertSortedBid(newBidIndex);
    currentCouponAmount += sellCouponAmount;
    totalSellReserveAmount += buyReserveAmount;


    if (bidCount > maxBids) {
      if (lowestBidIndex == newBidIndex) {
        revert BidAmountTooLow();
      }
      _removeBid(lowestBidIndex);
    }


    // Remove and refund out of range bids
    removeExcessBids();


    // Check if the new bid is still on the map after removeBids
    if (bids[newBidIndex].bidder == address(0)) {
      revert BidAmountTooLow();
    }


    emit BidPlaced(newBidIndex,msg.sender, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);


    return newBidIndex;
  }
```

**Issue:**
- **Missing Minimum Threshold Check**: The function checks if `buyReserveAmount` is greater than zero but does not enforce a sensible minimum value, such as a percentage of the total reserve or a fixed minimum token amount. This oversight allows attackers to submit bids with extremely low `buyReserveAmount`, potentially skewing the auction dynamics.

### Attack Path

**Exploit Scenario:**

1. **Attacker's Action**:
    - Deploys a bid with a **very small** `buyReserveAmount` (e.g., 1 wei) and a **large** `sellCouponAmount`.
    - Example: `bid(1 wei, 1,000,000,000)`.

2. **Consequences**:
    - The attacker’s bid is inserted into the bid list without a meaningful reserve contribution.
    - Other bidders, observing the high `sellCouponAmount` relative to the `buyReserveAmount`, may perceive the auction as uncompetitive or fraudulent, leading to reduced participation.
    - The auction’s bid sorting mechanism (`insertSortedBid`) could prioritize or misplace the attacker’s bid, disrupting fair competition.

3. **Potential Outcomes**:
    - **Bid List Saturation**: The attacker can flood the bid list with multiple minimal bids, exhausting the `maxBids` limit and blocking legitimate bids.
    - **Denial of Service**: Legitimate users may be unable to place bids, halting the auction process and preventing proper distribution of coupons.

### Impact

**Impact:**
- **Auction Manipulation**: An attacker can disrupt the natural ordering of bids by inserting artificially skewed bids that are difficult for legitimate participants to outbid.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: By saturating the bid list with minimal `buyReserveAmount` bids, attackers can prevent the addition of genuine bids, effectively halting the auction process.
- **Fairness Compromise**: The integrity of the auction is compromised, leading to potential loss of trust among users and stakeholders.

This vulnerability aligns with the system's invariants, particularly the expectation that the redemption of leverage tokens remains non-zero as long as bonds are issued, and that core auction functionalities operate without disruption.

### Mitigation

### **Recommendations**

**Implement a Minimum Threshold for `buyReserveAmount`**:
    - Introduce a **minimum bid limit** to ensure that each bid contributes meaningfully to the auction's reserve pool.
