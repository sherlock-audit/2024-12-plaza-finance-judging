# Chainlink oracle price can be 0 or negative, but the protocol doesn't check for that

# Summary

Chainlink Oracle price can be 0 or negative and there is no check to ensure that this is not the case.

# Root Cause

The Chainlink Oracle can return 0 or negative value for the price. The [`OracleReader::getOraclePrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L68) gets this price from the oracle, but the function doesn't check if the `answer` has zero or negative value. Therefore, the function can return 0 or wrong price and break the functionality of the protocol.

# Impact

If the Chainlink Oracle returns 0 or negative price, the `getOraclePrice` function will return 0 or incorrect price (very high price) and this will break the functionality of the whole protocol.

# PoC

The `OracleReader::getOraclePrice` gets the Chainlink oracle price for a given feed using the `AggregatorV3Interface` and the `latestRoundData` function:

```solidity

function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns(uint256) {
    bool isInverted = false;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(quote, base);
    
    if (feed == address(0)) {
      feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(base, quote);
      if (feed == address(0)) {
        revert NoFeedFound();
      }

      // Invert the price
      isInverted = true;
    }
@>  (,int256 answer,,uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
    
    if (updatedTimestamp + OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).feedHeartbeats(feed) < block.timestamp) {
      revert StalePrice();
    }

    uint256 decimals = uint256(AggregatorV3Interface(feed).decimals());
    return isInverted ? (10 ** decimals * 10 ** decimals) / uint256(answer) : uint256(answer);
  }
```

The problem is that the `answer` can be 0 or negative. If the `answer` is 0 and the price is inverted, the function `getOraclePrice` will revert due to division by zero. If the price is not inverted the function will return 0 and other protocol's functions as [`Pool::getCreateAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L306-L344), [`Pool::getRedeemAMount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L477-L525) will revert due to division by zero or underflow.

If the `answer` has negative value and the price is inverted, then the returned price from `getOraclePrice` will be 0, because `(10 ** decimals * 10 ** decimals) / uint256(answer)` this line divides to a very big number. If a negative value is passed to `uint256`, the result will be very high value due of the underflow. Also, if the price is not inverted, the return price will be incorrect (very high value) due to the same reason. Negative value is passt to the `uint256` and the result from that is a very high number.

This will break the protocol's functionality.

# Mitigation

Check if the returned price (answer) in the `getOraclePrice` function is 0 or negative.
