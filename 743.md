# Bond token owners can claim tokens up till period even if the auction for the period is not yet completed griefing other users of their funds until the auction is over

### Summary

when an auction is created, a user is immediately owed tokens from that auction
as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L567)  the contract increments the period of the bond token once the auction is created (period X to X + 1)
assuming user bob transfer tokens to himself, he immediately updates the total shares owed to him to include period x 



### Root Cause

users shares are updated to the current period - 1 and not the last period with a completed auction 

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

users will lose access to their funds for the duration of auction period 

### PoC

using a simple example  
uisng the fitst(0th) period 
the share per token of the 0th period is initialized when the contract is created 

auction is created for the 0th period and the current period reaches 0 + 1 = 1 
since users can claim shares on all periods except the current one 
bobs tokens are for the 0th period are immediately made available to him despite the tokens not being available and the bob cannot withdraw 

lets now consider a case where there are tokens in the distribution contract due to other users not yet withdrawing their tokens from other periods 
auction is created for period x 
bob immediately gets access to his tokens at period x, bob can then withdraw tokens belonging to other users and this users will not be able to withdraw their tokens until the auction at period x is complete, at ehich point bobs token will  be restock the contract while bob would have already burned his shares 

### Mitigation

In the bond token contract, users shares should be updated to the last completed auction
