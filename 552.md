# A malicious actor could DOS the `createPool()` function in `PreDeposit.sol`

### Summary

The check that ensures `reserveAmount` doesn't reach the `reserveCap` could allow a hacker to DOS the `createPool()` function by frontrunning users transactions and depositing an amount equal to `reserveCap` then calling `withdraw()` to get his funds back and wait for other users to try and deposit and repeat the same attack.
causing every deposit transaction to revert on the following line:

### Root Cause

the choice of allowing users to withdraw their funds after depositing via [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L136) is a mistake as a Malicious user could keep frontrunning deposit transaction till the deposit period ends DOSing the `createPool()` function.
note: attacker must ensure `reserveAmount` is equal to zero when deposit period ended.
```solidity
  function createPool() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (reserveAmount == 0) revert NoReserveAmount();
    if (bondAmount == 0 || leverageAmount == 0) revert InvalidBondOrLeverageAmount();
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
    IERC20(params.reserveToken).approve(address(factory), reserveAmount);
    pool = factory.createPool(params, reserveAmount, bondAmount, leverageAmount, bondName, bondSymbol, leverageName, leverageSymbol, true);

    emit PoolCreated(pool);
    poolCreated = true;
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

`reserveCap` must be reachable (not very big).

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A normal user calls `deposit()` in order to get some bond and leverage tokens at the end.
2. A malicious user that was monitoring the mempool sees the user transaction and frontrun it and depositing an ammount equal to `reserveCap` ensuring the `reserveAmount == reserveCap`.
3. The normal user transaction will revert due to the check in [the `deposit()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L119).
4. The malicious user then withdraw his funds and get back his funds.
5. at the end the `createPool()` will keep reverting due to this [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L150).


### Impact

This could lead to bad user experience and some pools can never been created.

### PoC

`reserveCap` is designed to control how much money get deposited in a pool by the protocol admin.
so, I assume it is reachable by wealthy users otherwise it could be removed.

### Mitigation

there are three solutions that can ensure this hack never happens:
1. remove the withdraw function.
2. remove the `reserveCap` or set it to a very high value which is the same thing.
3. the third one which i think is the best solution: is to apply a penalty for users who withdraw their funds, this would cost an attacker a lot of money.
