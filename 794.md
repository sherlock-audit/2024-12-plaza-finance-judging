# Attacker will drain the protocol of its reserve tokens

### Summary

The vulnerability in Auction.sol allows an attacker to drain up to 90% of the pool's ReserveToken supply in a single malicious transaction by exploiting the lack of validation between buyReserveAmount and sellCouponAmount in the [bid function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125). Although the system has safeguards like the poolSaleLimit (set to 90%) in place, these do not adequately prevent the exploit. Furthermore, the absence of penalties for malicious bids exacerbates the risk.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the missing validation logic between the buyReserveAmount and sellCouponAmount in the bid function. This allows the attacker to submit bids with an abnormally high buyReserveAmount (close to the pool's reserves) while staying below MAX_BID_AMOUNT. The system erroneously accepts such bids without assessing their proportionality or impact.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Pool Configuration:**

- The poolSaleLimit is initialized to MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT (90%) in Pool.sol. This sets an upper cap on the pool reserves that can be auctioned.
- The MAX_BID_AMOUNT is sufficiently high, allowing attackers to craft large bids.

2. **Auction Initialization:**

- During deployment, the Pool contract initializes Auction.sol and sets the maximum number of bids to 1000.

3. **Bid Function Logic:**

- The bid function in Auction.sol does not validate the proportionality of buyReserveAmount and sellCouponAmount, enabling attackers to input malicious values.

### External Pre-conditions

No specific external conditions are required for this attack.

### Attack Path

**1st Attack Path**

The attacker exploits the [bid function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125) by providing a sellCouponAmount that satisfies [slotSize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L382) condition and a disproportionately high buyReserveAmount (potentially near the pool reserves), while keeping it below [MAX_BID_AMOUNT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L76).

This exploit works because there is no compatibility check between buyReserveAmount and sellCouponAmount in the bid function. However, a protective [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341) exists in the endAuction function of Auction.sol:
```solidity
        } else if (
            totalSellReserveAmount >=
            (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100
        ) {
            state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
        }
```
Here, poolSaleLimit is initialized to [MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L39) (90%) in the [initialize function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L135)  of Pool.sol at [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L165):
```solidity
    function initialize(
        .
        .
        .
    ) public initializer {
        .
        .
        .
        poolSaleLimit = MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
        .
        .
    }
```

Key Issue:
While this check prevents the auction from liquidating the entire pool reserve, it still allows up to 90% of the pool's ReserveToken supply to be auctioned. This creates a significant vulnerability.

An attacker can submit a single bid with a high buyReserveAmount (just under 90% of the pool reserves) and effectively drain 90% of the ReserveToken supply from the pool.

**Supporting Conditions:**

- Low Transaction Requirements:
When pool contract deploys Auction.sol it sets the maximum number of bids to 1000 by calling the initialize function of Auction.sol, see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L560). 
Thus max number of bids allowed in the auction are set to 1000 [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L108). 
But to make this attack successfull attacker does not need a thousand transaction, attacker only needs 1. Even one single bogus transaction can get the attacker hold on MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT(90%) of the pool reserves.  

- No Penalty for Malicious Bids:
There is no downside or penalty for sending abnormal transactions to the bid function. This opens the door for anyone or everyone to perform the attack by submitting malicious bids without consequence.


**2nd Attack Path:**
The protocol team is expecting such instances were the  auction would get less coupon tokens than necessary, therefore the auction will fill only partially, [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L339).
Here the attacker can send just the right amount of couponTokens = totalBuyCouponAmount - currentCouponAmount,  and pass huge buyReserveAmount in the bid function.
This would lead to the attacker getting around 90% of pool reserve supply.



### Impact

The protocol suffers a catastrophic loss of up to 90% of its pool reserves (MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT). The attacker gains control of these drained funds while giving to the protocol far less amount of coupon tokens. Attacker can do this without any penalty or downside for their actions.
