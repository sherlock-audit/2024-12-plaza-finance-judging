# User can front-run Auction to gain coupon payment as if they held for entire period duration

### Summary

The current period is only incremented once the Auction starts. Users can observe the transaction that starts the auction, and front-run it by buying bondETH and will be rewarded for the coupon payments for that bond period as if they held the bond for the duration of the period. 

### Root Cause

When a user buys bondETH, the period which they receive the bondETH is tracked internally to allocate coupon payments for the bond holder for each distribution period that they hold for.

 In addition, the global period remains the same until an auction is started after the duration period ends, then it is incremented to the next period index.

Because of this, a user can front-run the start of the auction and purchase any amount of bondETH (lets say it is significantly large) -> in turn `BondToken.sol` will update the users accounting to show that they held for the current period -> making them entitled to the coupon payment for the newly purchased bonds, even though they did not hold during the period. This will add pressure to the auction.

Lets say the currentPeriod = 2 ; and the user front-runs the auction for period 2 and purchases the bonds. In the internal accounting they will have held the bonds for period 2, making them entitled to the coupon payment for that period because the currentPeriod remains at 2 until the auction starts, then it is incremented to 3.



### Impact

When the auction starts, the `Pool.sol` will calculate the total amount of couponTokens needed to be raised, which will include the front-run bonds and the Auction will have many more coupon tokens that it needs to raise. If the user purchased a significant amount of bonds, this can be a large amount.

After the end of the auction, the user will be able to `claim` the coupon payment from the `Distributor` contract which will allocate to them the coupon payment for that period because the internal accounting shows they held bonds for that period.

The user can collect the coupon payment and immediately sell the bondToken back to the protocol and redeem their assets. The user can do this after every distribution period and receive coupon payments for that period without ever holding bond tokens for any amount of time within that period. 



### Mitigation

There can be two methods for avoiding this:

- calculate the period that the user receives bond tokens by checking the time they received them against the lastDistribution time + the distributionPeriod to ensure they had the bond tokens within the period.

- Use automation to call the function to start the auction once the distributionPeriod has been met.
