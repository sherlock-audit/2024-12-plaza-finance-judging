# Incorrect Share Calculation Due to Historical Period Balance Misrepresentation

### Summary

In BondToken, the [`getIndexedUserAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L195) function incorrectly uses the current token balance for calculating shares across all historical periods. This leads to inflated share calculations for users who received tokens after earlier periods, as they get credited shares as if they held their current balance during all previous periods.


### Root Cause

In the `getIndexedUserAmount` function:
```javascript
function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;
    
    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
        // Uses current balance instead of historical balance
        shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }
    return shares;
}
```
The issue arises because:

1. The function takes the current balance as input
2. It applies this current balance to ALL historical periods
3. This means users get shares for periods when they may have held fewer or no tokens

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The root cause is that the share calculation mechanism:

1. Doesn't store historical balances per period
2. Uses current balance as a proxy for historical holdings
3. Lacks proper accounting of when users received their tokens

### Mitigation

Track historical balances per period
