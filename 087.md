# Tokens can still be minted and burned when the contract is paused.

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/LeverageToken.sol#L96C3-L113C4

The LeverageToken smart contract is designed to implement a pausable, upgradeable ERC20 token with access control. It includes mechanisms to pause token transfers, mints, burns, and indexing updates via the pause() function, which should be callable only by the SECURITY_COUNCIL_ROLE from the PoolFactory. However, users can still burn and mint which is not intended.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/LeverageToken.sol#L96C3-L113C4

The contract aims to pause all token transfers, mints, burns, and indexing updates when the pause() function is invoked.
This is indicated by the comment in the pause() function:


/**
 * @dev Pauses all token transfers, mints, burns, and indexing updates.
 * @notice Can only be called by addresses with the SECURITY_COUNCIL_ROLE. Does not prevent contract upgrades.
 */
Actual Implementation of Pause Logic:

The contract uses the whenNotPaused modifier to prevent certain functions from executing when the contract is paused.
The _update function, which is called during token transfers, includes this modifier:
solidity

function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused() {
  super._update(from, to, amount);
}
However, the mint and burn functions do not include the whenNotPaused modifier:
solidity

function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
  _mint(to, amount);
}

function burn(address account, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
  _burn(account, amount);
}


When the contract is paused, no token transfers, mints, or burns should occur.
Since the mint and burn functions lack the whenNotPaused modifier, they can still be executed by accounts with the MINTER_ROLE, even when the contract is paused, which is not intended.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Tokens can be minted or burned during the paused state, potentially leading to unauthorized alterations in the token supply.
This could be exploited by a malicious actor with the MINTER_ROLE or result from an unintended action during a critical period.

Users and other smart contracts interacting with LeverageToken might assume that the paused state fully halts all token operations. The ability to mint and burn tokens contrary to this assumption can lead to unexpected behaviors and bugs in dependent systems.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the whenNotPaused modifier to the mint and burn functions to enforce the intended behavior.

function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    _mint(to, amount);
}

function burn(address account, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    _burn(account, amount);
}
