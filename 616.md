# Possible distribution manipulation cuz additional deposit/redeem

### Summary

The number of coupon tokens received at the auction may differ from the number of coupon tokens that will be distributed due to possible manipulation by users, as they may deposit during the distribution period and increase the `balanceOf()` value used to calculate the value tokens for distribution.

### Root Cause

The [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L87) on the possible issue in the `Distribution` smart contract.

The amount of coupon tokens for distribution depends on the current balance of the user's bond tokens. This means that the user can easily manipulate the distribution amount with making deposit. 

`uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);`
`uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)`
`                .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());`

This issue is described in-depth in this your audit [report](https://file.notion.so/f/f/082d2312-4715-4914-8f85-448446db8bd8/c09fe83d-e2c5-4208-b5c9-f7cd288ea06b/Programmable_Derivatives_-_Zellic_Audit_Report_Draft.pdf?table=block&id=17a3b674-4d76-80de-84ef-c9a3bddfcc3a&spaceId=082d2312-4715-4914-8f85-448446db8bd8&expirationTimestamp=1737604800000&signature=v8tKB_ePx82W4YiTebVwY0kklQk0tK83szvP5VUJDBc&downloadName=Programmable+Derivatives+-+Zellic+Audit+Report+Draft.pdf) with number 3.9.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Initial settings:
  The coupon tokens for distribution period set as 100.
  1 Bond Token : 1 Coupon Token

Attack:
1. Olivia has 1 Bond Token, so she can claim 1 Coupon Token.
2. Olivia makes a deposit and receives 99 Bond Tokens as a result.
3. Olivia claims all 100 coupon tokens.

Result: 
Olivia has claimed all possible tokens (initial set up is 100 tokens), so other holders don't have possibility to claim their tokens.

### Impact

Since currently the distribution logic depends on `totalSupply()` and users can make a deposit during distribution period, they will receive more coupon tokens, although this is incorrect.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Prevent users from depositing or redeeming during the auction period, as this affects the distribution calculation. Don`t use the `balanceOf()` to determine how much users can claim because it can be manipulated.
