# Missing Time Validation in Pool's distribute() Function Allows Premature Distribution

### Summary

Missing time validation in Pool's distribute() function will allow coupon tokens to be distributed before both the distribution period and auction period have elapsed, enabling premature distributions by allowing users to bypass intended protocol timing constraints.

### Root Cause

In Pool.sol, while the function comment states that distribute() "can only be called after the distribution period has passed", and the protocol design requires both distribution and auction periods to complete, there is no validation check for these timing requirements:

```solidity
**
 * @dev Distributes coupon tokens to bond token holders.
 * Can only be called after the distribution period has passed.
 */
function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());
    
    // Missing check for distribution + auction period
    
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    // ...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Anyone can call distribute() immediately after an auction ends rather than waiting for the distribution period, which violates the intended protocol timing constraints. This could lead to premature distribution of coupon tokens and misalignment with the protocol's economic model.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a timing check

```solidity
function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod < block.timestamp, "Distribution+Auction period not passed"); 
    
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());
    // ...
}
```
