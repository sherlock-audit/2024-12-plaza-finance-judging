# Missing check for negative or zero answer in OracleReader::getOraclePrice()

### Summary

It could lead to division by zero if the answer is 0 [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L75)
It could also revert with overflow if the answer is negative since `uint256(int256(-x)) == type(uint256).max` at least that would be a good scenario.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L68 it should check if the answer is <= 0

### Internal Pre-conditions

If `isInverted = true` and if the `answer` from chainlink is 0, then it result in a division by zero error.

### External Pre-conditions

If the `answer` from chainlink is negative value then we want to check for this kind of scenario and not rely on solidity to revert on overflow.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

related [issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/94)

overflow/panic reverts for a bad `latestRoundData` answer because of the type casting from int256(-x) to uint256. It's good to have a check in this kind of situation and not relying on overflow to revert the transaction.

### Mitigation

```diff
  function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns(uint256) {
    bool isInverted = false;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(quote, base);
    
    if (feed == address(0)) {
      feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(base, quote);
      if (feed == address(0)) {
        revert NoFeedFound();
      }

      // Invert the price
      isInverted = true;
    }
    (,int256 answer,,uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
    
    if (updatedTimestamp + OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).feedHeartbeats(feed) < block.timestamp) {
      revert StalePrice();
    }

+ require(answer > 0, "Chainlink answer reporting 0"); // or create custom error(better idea)

    uint256 decimals = uint256(AggregatorV3Interface(feed).decimals());
    return isInverted ? (10 ** decimals * 10 ** decimals) / uint256(answer) : uint256(answer);
  }
