# Flash Loan Amplification Attack: Attackers will amplify oracle manipulation through flash loans causing severe price distortions

### Summary

Lack of balance validation combined with flash loan capabilities will cause severe price manipulation vulnerability for protocol users as attackers will use borrowed funds to create extreme pool imbalances

### Root Cause

In src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol#L129-L140), the choice to ignore pool balances when calculating prices is a mistake as it allows flash loan attacks to create extreme price manipulations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Oracle must calculate prices without balance validation
2. The pool must be susceptible to large trades
3. Price calculation must depend on instantaneous pool state


### External Pre-conditions

1. Flash loan providers must be available
2. The pool must have sufficient liquidity for large trades
3. MEV infrastructure must be accessible

### Attack Path

1. Attacker obtains flash loan of target tokens
2. Executes large trades to create extreme imbalance
3. Oracle reads manipulated state
4. Protocol executes transaction with invalid price
5. Attacker reverses positions and repays flash loan


### Impact

Protocol users can suffer losses of 10-20% per manipulation due to amplified price distortions. Attacker gains extracted value minus flash loan fees.

### PoC

```solidity
contract FlashLoanAmplificationTest is Test {
    BalancerOracleAdapter public oracle;
    MockBalancerPool public pool;
    MockFlashLoanProvider public flashLoaner;
    
    function setUp() public {
        pool = new MockBalancerPool();
        oracle = new BalancerOracleAdapter();
        flashLoaner = new MockFlashLoanProvider();
        
        // Initial setup
        pool.setBalances([1000e18, 1000e18]);
    }
    
    function testFlashLoanAttack() public {
        // Get initial price
        (,int256 initialPrice,,) = oracle.latestRoundData();
        
        // Execute flash loan attack
        vm.startPrank(address(this));
        uint256 flashAmount = 5000e18;
        flashLoaner.executeLoan(
            address(pool.token0()),
            flashAmount,
            abi.encodeWithSignature("executeAttack()")
        );
        
        // Check price impact
        (,int256 attackPrice,,) = oracle.latestRoundData();
        uint256 priceImpact = uint256(attackPrice - initialPrice);
        assertGt(priceImpact, initialPrice / 10); // >10% impact
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Implement TWAP for price calculations
2. Add balance change circuit breakers
3. Implement maximum balance deviation checks
