# User is able to claim usdc for new period even if auction not ended yet in case there is enough unclaimed shares

### Summary

By design once auction started we update the period, to let user claim coupons for previous period. Meanwhile we allocate coupons to distributor only when auctioned ended.

Pool.sol startAuction()
```solidity
    // Increase the bond token period
    bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);
```
where BondToken.sol increseIndexedAssetPerioud() increses period to new one (++).
```solidity
  function increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(uint256 sharesPerToken) public onlyRole(DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused() {
    globalPool.previousPoolAmounts.push(
      PoolAmount({
        period: globalPool.currentPeriod,
        amount: totalSupply(),
        sharesPerToken: globalPool.sharesPerToken
      })
    );
    globalPool.currentPeriod++;
    globalPool.sharesPerToken = sharesPerToken;

    emit IncreasedAssetPeriod(globalPool.currentPeriod, sharesPerToken);
  }
```
This creates dangerous situation:
1) The user will able to claim his coupons for newly updated period (coupons which wasn't received yet) in case it is enough unclaimed coupons in a pool for someone's previous unclaimed periods.
2) If auction will fail (oversold or undersold) then user shoudn't be eligible for such claims, but he will receives them
3) Protocol insolvent to handle re-distribution in case auction failed (since balances changed, some funds unfairly distributed)

In my opinion the root case for each of those impacts is updating period when auction started (not ended successfully)


  

### Root Cause

```solidity
    // Increase the bond token period
    bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);
```
where BondToken.sol increseIndexedAssetPerioud() increses period to new one (++).
```solidity
  function increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(uint256 sharesPerToken) public onlyRole(DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused() {
    globalPool.previousPoolAmounts.push(
      PoolAmount({
        period: globalPool.currentPeriod,
        amount: totalSupply(),
        sharesPerToken: globalPool.sharesPerToken
      })
    );
    globalPool.currentPeriod++;
    globalPool.sharesPerToken = sharesPerToken;

    emit IncreasedAssetPeriod(globalPool.currentPeriod, sharesPerToken);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1)Auction failed
2)There is some unclaimed funds for users for previous periods in distributor contract

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Once auction started user claims unclaimed by someone coupon in distributor

### Impact

steal funds, dos of ability to claim shares for those users who didn't do this yet, dos of post distribution in case of fail auction

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

update period only when auction end successfully
