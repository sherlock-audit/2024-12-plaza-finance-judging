# Incorrect calculation with using poolSaleLimit in the endAuction() function

### Summary

The `endAuction()` function of the `Auction` smart contract uses an incorrect divisor (precision) in the calculation for determining whether the pool sale limit is reached. This results in a significantly lower threshold, leading to unintended state transitions and potentially incorrect auction outcomes.

### Root Cause

The `endAuction()` function contains a condition that determines the state of the pool and whether the sale limit has been reached. However, the calculation in the condition is incorrect.

[The link on the issue.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341)

The `poolSaleLimit` value is set as a scaled percentage in initialize() function (e.g., 95000 represents 95% according to NatSpec docs), but the calculation divides by 100 instead of 100000 (100%). This results in a significantly lower threshold, leading to unintended state transitions and potentially incorrect auction outcomes.

`else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
 }`


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Set `poolSaleLimit` to 95000 (95%).
2. Initiate an auction with sufficient bids to approach the pool sale limit.
3. Observe premature state transitions when the actual pool sale limit is not reached due to incorrect scaling.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incorrect calculation leads to incorrect operation of the auction and changes in its status.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the divisor from 100 to 100000 to correctly account for the scaling of `poolSaleLimit`.
