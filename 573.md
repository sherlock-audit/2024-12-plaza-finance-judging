# Chainlink Has No Price Feed for WSTETH/USD on Base, WSTETH Cannot Be Used as a Reserve Token

### Summary

The protocol intends to use wstETH as a reserve token for one of its pools. 
However, the current `Pool.sol` logic requires Chainlink price feeds that price the reserve asset directly in USD. On Base, Chainlink does not provide a WSTETH/USD price feed, only a WSTETH/ETH feed. 
Thus the protocol cannot use wstETH as a reserve token without additional handling.  

### Root Cause

The `Pool.sol` logic assumes that all reserve tokens have a direct USD price feed, as it relies on the `getOraclePrice` function to fetch the RESERVE_ASSET/USD price. 
Since WSTETH/USD is unavailable on Base, the system cannot calculate the required values for pool operations like creation and redemption.  

### Internal Pre-conditions

- wstETH is selected as a reserve token for a pool.  

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Not applicable. 

### Impact

The protocol, in its current form, cannot support wstETH as a reserve token on the Base chain. 

### PoC

In `Pool.sol`, critical functions such as `simulateCreate` and `simulateRedeem` rely on the RESERVE_ASSET/USD price feed. The relevant logic is as follows:  

### `simulateCreate`  
[View in source code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L290)  

```solidity
function simulateCreate(TokenType tokenType, uint256 depositAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
    ...
    return getCreateAmount(
        tokenType,
        depositAmount,
        bondSupply,
        levSupply,
        poolReserves,
        getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD), // @audit Priced against USD
        getOracleDecimals(reserveToken, USD)
    ).normalizeAmount(COMMON_DECIMALS, assetDecimals);
}
```  

### `simulateRedeem`  
[View in source code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L459)  

```solidity
function simulateRedeem(TokenType tokenType, uint256 depositAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
    ...
    return getRedeemAmount(
        tokenType,
        depositAmount,
        bondSupply,
        levSupply,
        poolReserves,
        getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD), // @audit Priced against USD
        oracleDecimals,
        marketRate
    ).normalizeAmount(COMMON_DECIMALS, IERC20(reserveToken).safeDecimals());
}
```  

### `OracleReader::getOraclePrice`  
[View in source code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L55-L76)  

The `getOraclePrice` function tries to fetch a price feed directly between the asset and USD or vice versa. If neither exists, it reverts:  

```solidity
function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns (uint256) {
    ...
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(quote, base);
    if (feed == address(0)) {
        feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(base, quote);
        if (feed == address(0)) {
            revert NoFeedFound();
        }
        isInverted = true;
    }
    ...
    return isInverted ? (10 ** decimals * 10 ** decimals) / uint256(answer) : uint256(answer);
}
```  

For wstETH on Base, the Chainlink price feeds currently lack a WSTETH/USD pair, as confirmed in their [documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=base&page=1&search=wsteth).  

### Mitigation

Modify the protocol to handle assets that only have an ASSET/ETH price feed. Specifically:  
1. Use the WSTETH/ETH price feed to get the price in ETH.  
2. Multiply this by the ETH/USD price from the existing ETH/USD price feed.  
3. Implement fallback logic in `getOraclePrice` or create a dedicated conversion function for this scenario.
