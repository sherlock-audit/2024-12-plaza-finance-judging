# Auction Contract Will Break Bid Claiming Mechanism for Auction Participants

### Summary

Improper bid state management in the auction contract will cause a critical functionality breakdown for auction participants as the contract will prevent legitimate bid claiming and refund processes.

### Root Cause

In `Auction.sol`, the bid removal mechanism [`_removeBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L298-L331) completely deletes bid information, causing unexpected behavior in bid claiming and refund processes. This is the normal flow of the protocol and would cause a big issue for the protocol if not mitigated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction must reach end state
2. Multiple bids must be placed
3. One bidder must claim a refund first

### External Pre-conditions

1. Auction contract must be in a state where bids can be claimed

### Attack Path

1. Place multiple bids in the auction
2. End the auction
3. First bidder claims refund
4. Subsequent bidders cannot claim their bids or refunds

### Impact

Auction participants cannot:

1. Claim winning bids
2. Receive refunds
3. Recover their tokens
4. Participate in auction settlement

### PoC

```solidity
function testBidClaimingBreakage() public {
    address bidder2 = address(0x222222);
    address bidder3 = address(0x333333);

    // Setup bids
    vm.startPrank(bidder);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 4000000000000 ether);
    auction.bid(1, slot);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(bidder2);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 4000000000000 ether);
    auction.bid(10, slot);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(bidder3);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 4000000000000 ether);
    auction.bid(15, slot);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
    vm.prank(pool);
    auction.endAuction();

    // First bidder claims refund
    vm.prank(bidder);
    auction.claimRefund(1);

    // Second bidder fails to claim refund
    vm.prank(bidder2);
    auction.claimRefund(1);

    // Subsequent bids fail to claim
    vm.prank(bidder3);
    vm.expectRevert(); // Will fail to claim
    auction.claimBid(1);
}
```

### Mitigation

Modify `_removeBid()` to mark bids as claimed instead of deleting
