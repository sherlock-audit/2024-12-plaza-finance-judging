# Users can sell `BondToken` at a higher price by manipulating the `collateralLevel` from `< 120%` to `> 120%` by purchasing `LeverageToken`.

### Summary

Buying `LeverageToken` increases TVL, which in turn raises the `collateralLevel`.

When redeeming `BondToken`, the redemption amount is determined by the `collateralLevel`. The calculation of the redemption amount varies depending on whether the `collateralLevel` is above or below `120%`.

Therefore, `BondToken` redeemers can acquire more underlying assets by manipulating the `collateralLevel` from `< 120%` to `> 120%` through purchasing `LeverageToken`, ultimately resulting in a profit.

### Root Cause

The [getRedeemAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L511-L518) function calculates the `redeemRate` based on whether the `collateralLevel` is above or below `120%`.

When `collateralLevel < 120%`, `80%` of TVL is allocated for `BondToken` holders. In contrast, when `collateralLevel > 120%`, the price of `BondToken` is fixed at `100`.

This vulnerability provides malicious users with an opportunity to manipulate the `collateralLevel` by purchasing `LeverageToken`, allowing them to redeem their `BondToken`s at a higher rate.

```solidity
      function getRedeemAmount(
        ...
        
        uint256 collateralLevel;
        if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND) {
498       collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
        } else {
          multiplier = POINT_TWO;
          assetSupply = levSupply;
502       collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
        ...
        
        uint256 redeemRate;
511     if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
          redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
513     } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
          redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
515     } else {
          redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
        }
        
        ...
      }
```

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

- Current State of the Pool:
    - `levSupply`: 100
    - `bondSupply`: 100
    - `TVL`: $11000
- Bob wants to redeem `50 BondToken`. Expected Values:
    - `collaterlLevel`: (11000 - 100 * 50) / (100 - 50) = 120% (see line 498)
    - Price of `BondToken`: 11000 * 0.8 / 100 = 88 (see the case at line 511)
    - Price of `LeverageToken`: 11000 * 0.2 / 100 = 22 (see the case at line 511)

As a result, Bob can only redeem `50 * 88 = 4400`.

However, Bob manipulates `collateralLevel`.

1. Bob buys `10 LeverageToken` by using `$220`:
    - `levSupply`: 100 + 10 = 110
    - `bondSupply`: 100
    - `TVL`: 11000 + 220 = 11220
2. Bob then sells `50 BondToken`:
    - `collaterlLevel`: (11220 - 100 * 50) / (100 - 50) = 124.4% (see line 498)
    - price of `BondToken`: 100 (see the case at line 515)
    
    Bob receives `100 * 50 = 5000`.
    
    - `TVL`: 11220 - 5000 = 6220
    - `bondSupply`: 100 - 50 = 50
3. Bob sells back `10 LeverageToken`.
    - `collaterlLevel`: 6220 / 50 = 124.4% (see line 502)
    - Price of `LeverageToken`: (6220 - 100 * 50) / 110 = 11 (see the case at line 513)
    - Bob receives `10 * 11 = 110`.

As you can see, Bob was initially able to redeem only `$4400`. However, by manipulating `collateralLevel`, he can increase his redemption to `-220 + 5000 + 110 = 4890`. Thus, he can profit by `4890 - 4400 = 490`.

### Impact

`BondToken` redeemers can obtain more than they are entitled to by manipulating the `collateralLevel` through purchasing `LeverageToken`.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The current price mechanism should be improved.
