# Missing Input Validation for Critical Addresses in PoolFactory

Summary
Missing Input Validation for Critical Addresses in PoolFactory

Root Cause
In PoolFactory.sol:initialize there are missing validation checks for critical addresses (_governance, _deployer, _oracleFeeds, and beacon implementations) which could allow zero addresses to be set during initialization.
In [PoolFactory.sol:L141-159]https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PoolFactory.sol#L92-L115) the initialize function lacks validation checks for critical addresses:
solidityCopyfunction initialize(
    address _governance,
    address _deployer,
    address _oracleFeeds,
    address _poolImplementation,
    address _bondImplementation,
    address _leverageImplementation,
    address _distributorImplementation
) initializer public {
    __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
    __Pausable_init();

    deployer = Deployer(_deployer);              // @audit no validation
    governance = _governance;                     // @audit no validation  
    oracleFeeds = _oracleFeeds;                  // @audit no validation
    _grantRole(GOV_ROLE, _governance);

    // Stores beacon implementation addresses
    poolBeacon = _poolImplementation;            // @audit no validation
    bondBeacon = _bondImplementation;            // @audit no validation
    leverageBeacon = _leverageImplementation;    // @audit no validation
    distributorBeacon = _distributorImplementation; // @audit no validation
}

Internal Pre-conditions
Contract must be in uninitialized state before initialization
Deployer needs access to call initialize() function

External Pre-conditions
The protocol becomes permanently broken and unusable. Specific impacts include:

If governance is address(0): Contract becomes ungovernable, no role management or upgrades possible
If deployer is address(0): Pool creation functionality breaks
If oracleFeeds is address(0): Price feed functionality fails
If any beacon is address(0): New pool creation fails

Recovery would require complete redeployment of the system and migration of all user funds.

Attack Path
Deployer calls initialize() with address(0) for one or more critical parameters:
solidityCopypoolFactory.initialize(
address(0), // governance
deployerAddress,
oracleFeeds,
poolBeacon,
bondBeacon,
leverageBeacon,
distributorBeacon
);

Contract becomes initialized with zero address(es) for critical components
Core functionality becomes permanently broken due to invalid addresses

Impact
The protocol becomes permanently broken and unusable. Specific impacts include:

If governance is address(0): Contract becomes ungovernable, no role management or upgrades possible
If deployer is address(0): Pool creation functionality breaks
If oracleFeeds is address(0): Price feed functionality fails
If any beacon is address(0): New pool creation fails

Recovery would require complete redeployment of the system and migration of all user funds.
