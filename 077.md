# Market rate of bondETH is wrongly used during redeeming levETH

### Summary

When redeeming reserve tokens from the pool with a collateral level of less than 1.2, the protocol uses a lesser value calculated according to the formula and market value of the token returned by the oracle.

The same is stated in the documentation, for example, this is an excerpt about the levETH redemption logic:
>If the collateral level is less than 1.2, the redemption price of 1 levETH is the lesser of 20% * the quantity of wstETH in the vault * the oracle price of wstETH / the amount of levETH outstanding and the oracle levETH price on Aerodrome.

However, we can see that in the code the market price of `bondETH` is used even during levETH redemption. This leads to incorrectly defined results of the amount of reserve tokens to redeem and eventually may result in losses for users or protocol

### Root Cause

In Pool.sol:443-451, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L443-L451 the  `redeem()` function always retrieves `marketRate` of bondToken even in the case of `tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE`.

Later, `marketRate` is used in `getRedeemAmount()` function to determine the amount of reserve tokens to send to the user:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L519-L521.

This effectively leads to wrong amount of tokens sent to the user. Precisely, a user redeeming levETH may receive tokens calculated as:
`(depositAmountOfLevETH * marketRateOfBondETH) / ETHPrice`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Feed for retrieving the market price of bondETH is set

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol or users may incur losses depending on the difference between the marketRate of bondETH and marketRate of levETH.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Retrieve and use the price of levETH token as marketRate in case of redeeming `tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE`.
