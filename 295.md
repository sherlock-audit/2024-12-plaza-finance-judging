# The whole app can be halted/ broken if startAuction() is being called too late

### Summary

In startAuction, there is a check that will always revert if being called too late. Protocol then can never start new auctions to sell underlying asset for coupon token.

### Root Cause

In startAuction(), there is a check if auction period hasn't passed:

Notice that for whatever reason, if we call startAuction() after `lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod`, the function will always revert. Then we can never start a new aunction again, since `lastDistribution` is only updated at the end of this function. Hence, the app goes into deadlock state.
