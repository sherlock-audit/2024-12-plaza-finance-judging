# Bid cant be removed for blacklisted account

### Summary

The protocol records auction bids and removes the lowest or excess bids under certain conditions. When bids are removed, the contract attempts to transfer the tokens back to the bidder. However, if a malicious user creates a bid and becomes blacklisted (e.g., through interaction with Tornado Cash or OFAC-sanctioned entities), these bids cant be removed preventing valid new bids and enabling attackers to acquire reserve tokens at unfairly low prices.

### Root Cause

Protocol uses USDC as a coupon token which has a blacklist feature. A malicious user can use this to his advantage. User can create bid with low price and become blacklisted (e.g., through interaction with Tornado Cash or OFAC-sanctioned entities). When max bids reached or excess amounts removal, `_removeBid` function would fail when attempting to transfer token to blacklisted account.

```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Removes a bid from the linked list.
   * @param bidIndex The index of the bid to remove.
   */
  function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
    Bid storage bidToRemove = bids[bidIndex];
    uint256 nextIndex = bidToRemove.nextBidIndex;
    uint256 prevIndex = bidToRemove.prevBidIndex;

//

    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

The coupon token (e.g., USDC) should have blacklist feature
The attacker engages in activities that result in the token being blacklisted.
The auction reaches its maxBids limit 



### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates a low-price bid 
2. The attacker engages in activities that result in the token being blacklisted.
3. The auction reaches its maxBids limit.
4. The protocol attempts to remove the lowest bid, but the _removeBid function fails due to the blacklisted token's inability to transfer.
5. The removal process halts, preventing new valid bids and blocking the auction mechanism.


### Impact

The auction is blocked, preventing new bids if the maxBids limit is reached.
 Malicious actors can manipulate the auction to obtain reserve tokens at an unfairly low price.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement different refund mechanism
