# Fee incosistency

### Summary

Protocol calculates fee with following way Pool.sol getFeeAmount()
```solidity
function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }
```
Meanwhile it creates certain inconsistency 

if protocol not charge fee often enough it makes bonds cheaper, leverage higher

if protocol not charge fee for a quarter and decide to charge it, the fee for new users who just entered will be unfair big.

if protocol not charged fee before auction end , the amount it charge after will be lower, because some part of reserves will be sold

example: 
there was 100 eth in the pool, fee 10%, we wasn't charged while whole quarter - fee will be 2.5 eth for this time (if we charged before)
lets say, on auction we sold 90 eth, 10 eth remains in pool - now if we charge fee it will be 0.25 eth

### Root Cause

```solidity
function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

can happens eventually, no need for special attack

### Impact

as i proved, user might lose funds and protocol might lose fee
example with auction proves there is edge case where undercharge of fee not depend on how often devs will charge it 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add enter fee
