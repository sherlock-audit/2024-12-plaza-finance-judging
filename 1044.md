# Bid Replacement Issue: New Bidder Can Replace Existing Bidders with Equal Price but Higher Volume

### Summary

In Auction.sol::bid(), when a new bid with the same price ratio (reserveAmount:sellCouponAmount) but a higher sellCouponAmount is placed, it can replace existing bids. This occurs even if only a portion of the new bid’s sellCouponAmount matches the replaced bids. The current behavior disregards the fairness of existing bids and may discourage smaller bidders.

### Root Cause


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125

The bid replacement logic in Auction.sol::bid() prioritizes bids with higher sellCouponAmount, regardless of whether the price ratio (reserveAmount:sellCouponAmount) remains constant:

As long as the new bid’s sellCouponAmount exceeds existing bids, the system will replace them, even if the price ratio remains identical.

### Internal Pre-conditions

	•	An auction allows a limited number of bids (e.g., 1000).
	•	Existing bids are in place with equal price ratios but smaller volumes.

### External Pre-conditions

	•	A new bidder places a bid with the same reserveAmount:sellCouponAmount ratio but a higher sellCouponAmount.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

	•	Smaller bidders with equivalent price ratios are unfairly displaced by higher-volume bids.
	•	This behavior reduces inclusivity and fairness, potentially alienating smaller participants in the auction

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the bid evaluation logic to ensure replacement occurs only when the new bid offers a higher price ratio (reserveAmount:sellCouponAmount):
