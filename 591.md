# other than 6 decimals tokens will results into incorrect calculations

## Description 

Bondholders will receive coupon tokens for each share during the distribution period, representing their fixed yield on bond tokens. The coupon token can be any token chosen as a fixed reward for the bondholders.

However, in the bondToken.sol contract, the constant SHARES_DECIMALS is set to 6, which assumes that the coupon token has 6 decimal places. This can cause incorrect calculations if the coupon token does not have 6 decimal places.

## Vulnerablilty Details

As we know , share decimals will always be 6. so when coupon token decimal will be other than 6, and calculation will be based on share decimals. it will be improper calculation for diff coupon token decimal

## Impact 

 protocol will be impacted due to wrong share calculations

## Mitigation

Protocol must use actual decimals of the coupon token, instead of hardcoded 6 decimals.
