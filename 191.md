# PoolFactory should not use `initilizer` modifier

### Summary

The `PoolFactory` is the main contract which is inherited by `Pool.sol`, BondToken.sol, Auction.sol therefore it should not use initializer modifier instead use onlyInitializing modifier.

### Root Cause

In this Inheritance model, the BondToke.sol and Pool.sol has its own initialize function which includes the initializer modifier and calls the initialize of PoolFactory.sol , The problem is that  both parent : PoolFactory and childlike contracts BondToken, Pool are using the initializer modifier which limits initialization to one call.

According to the OpenZepplin documentation the [onlyinitializing](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-initializer--) modifier should be used to allow initialization in both the parent and child contracts. The [onlyinitializing](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-initializer--) ensures when thee intialize function is called any contract in its inheritance can still complete their own initialization.

> > A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once. In its scope, onlyInitializing functions can be used to initialize parent contracts.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

In this scenario, no direct attack or monetary loss is likely. However, the vulnerability causes a significant operational issue, preventing inheriting contracts from completing initialization. This could lead to a failure in the deployment of critical protocol components, affecting the overall system functionality.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Replace the initializer modifier in the PoolFactory.sol with onlyinializing
