# Invalid check for existing auction in `Pool::startAuction(...)` could lead to issues

### Summary

When a new auction is to be started, the Pool contract will do a check for an existing one. However, with the current logic, the check will never raise an error, if an auction has been started, as the auction itself will be stored in the `auctions` arrays with the previous period:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L537-L539
```solidity
 function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
__SNIP__
    // Check if auction for current period has already started
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
@>    require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0), AuctionAlreadyStarted()); // This will always be true, as when an auction is started it saved in the auctions array with the previous period, not the current one
__SNIP__
    // Increase the bond token period
@>    bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken); // @audit - current period is increased.

    // Update last distribution time
    lastDistribution = block.timestamp;
  }
```

From the above, if for any reason an active auction is not ended on time, and a new one is started, data inconsistencies could occur. The same issue is observed in the `NotInAuction` modfier:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L750-L754

```solidity
  modifier NotInAuction() {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
@>    require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0), AuctionIsOngoing()); // @audit - always true
    _;
  }
```

### Root Cause

Improper period sent to `auctions` array, leads to `require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0)` being always true if an auction has been started.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Have an auction that has not been ended.


### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Start a new auction before the previous one has been distributed.
2. No distribution will be done for the auction that was not properly ended.

----

1. `GOV_ROLE` uses `NotInAuction` protected functions, thinking it will revert if there is an active auction.
2. Changes are applied during an active auction.

### Impact

1. In some corner cases, when a new auction is started before the previous ends, the distribution flow of coupons could be affected.
2. When the `GOV_ROLE` uses functions that are protected by the `NotInAuction`, some improper state updates could happen affecting auctions.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Consider using the proper `currentPeriod - 1` notation, as used in the `distribute` function.
