# Market Risk


### Summary
A malicious user can temporarily create bondETH from the market, receive coupons, and then remove it. 
The owner of bondETH does not need to retain the bondETH after receiving the coupon.
Therefore, they all remove the bondETH from the market and purchase it before the auction starts.

### Root Cause
Anyone can call the `Pool.sol::startAuction()` function, at which point coupons are supplied to the owners of bondETH. However, a malicious user can exploit this by temporarily creating bondETH from the market, receiving coupons, and then removing it.

```solidity
Pool.sol
530:function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
        // Check if distribution period has passed
        require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod < block.timestamp, DistributionPeriodNotPassed());

        // Check if auction period hasn't passed
        require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());

        // Check if auction for current period has already started
        (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
        require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0), AuctionAlreadyStarted());

        uint8 bondDecimals = bondToken.decimals();
        uint8 sharesDecimals = bondToken.SHARES_DECIMALS();
        uint8 maxDecimals = bondDecimals > sharesDecimals ? bondDecimals : sharesDecimals;

        uint256 normalizedTotalSupply = bondToken.totalSupply().normalizeAmount(bondDecimals, maxDecimals);
        uint256 normalizedShares = sharesPerToken.normalizeAmount(sharesDecimals, maxDecimals);

        // Calculate the coupon amount to distribute
        uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)
            .toBaseUnit(maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

        auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
            address(new Auction()),
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                Auction.initialize.selector,
                address(couponToken),
                address(reserveToken),
                couponAmountToDistribute,
                block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
                1000,
                address(this),
                poolSaleLimit

        );

        // Update last distribution time
        lastDistribution = block.timestamp;

### PoC
When buying bondETH:
`tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserve)`, `collateralLevel = tvl / (bondSupply * 100)`.
if `collateralLevel <= 1.2`, 
    `creationRate = tvl * 0.8 / bondSupply`.
if `collateralLevel > 1.2`, 
    `creationRate = 100.

When selling bondETH:
`tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserve)`, `collateralLevel = (tvl - bondToSell * 100) / ((bondSupply - bondToSell) * 100)`.
if `collateralLevel <= 1.2`, 
    `redeemRate = tvl * 0.8 / bondSupply`.
if `collateralLevel > 1.2`, 
    `redeemRate = 100`.

Assming: `poolReserve = 100 ETH`, `bondSupply = 1000 bondETH`, `ETH price = $3000`
Step1: The attacker buy bondETH amount of 50 ETH:
    `tvl = 3000 * 100 = 3e5`, `collateralLevel = 3e5 / (1000 * 100) = 3 > 1.2`, `creationRate = 100`.
    Here, assuming the marketRate to $99.
    `minted = 50 * 3000 / 100 = 1500`.
Step2: The attacker creat Auction:
    attacker receive 1500 * 2.5 = 3750($)
Step3: The attacker sells all bondETH.
    tvl = 3000 * 150 = 4.5e5, collateralLevel = (4.5e5 - 1500 * 1000) / (1000 * 100) = 3 > 1.2, redeemRate = min(100, marketRate) = 99.
    redeemAmount = 99 * 1500 / 3000 = 49.5.
As a result, attacker's gain = 3750 - (50 - 49.5) * 3000 = 2250($).

- design decision clarify
In sherlock doc:
>Design decisions are not valid issues. Even if the design is suboptimal, but doesn't imply any loss of funds, these issues are considered informational.
If design decision imply any loss of funds, it could be valid.

### Impact
This design choice leads to several issues:
1. The market allows unnecessary spending, causing losses to levETH owners.
2. bondETH will no longer be needed until the next auction starts after distributing coupons, prompting all users to remove their bondETH from the market. At that time, levETH owners will have no incentive to invest in this market without bondETH, resulting in a significant loss of liquidity.
Consequently, there will be no need for anyone to create bondETH or levETH from this market.

### Mitigation
When distributing coupons, consider using accumulated balances instead of current balances
