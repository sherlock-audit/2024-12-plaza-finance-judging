# Truncation in Redeem Rate Calculation Will Lead to Incorrect Redemption Amounts

### Summary

A potential truncation error in the redeem rate calculation for leverage tokens in the `getRedeemAmount` function will lead to incorrect redemption amounts, as the calculation lacks proper precision adjustments for intermediate results.

### Root Cause

In the getRedeemAmount function, the calculation of redeemRate for TokenType.LEVERAGE uses the formula:
```solidity
((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION.
```
This calculation can truncate values due to integer division, leading to inaccurate results for redeemRate.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The tokenType must be TokenType.LEVERAGE.
2. The tvl and (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE) values must not be multiples of assetSupply, causing truncation during division.
3. The collateralLevel must exceed COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD, triggering the calculation of redeemRate for leverage tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The ethPrice or poolReserves values from the oracle must change, impacting the tvl calculation.
2. External input to bondSupply, levSupply, or depositAmount affects the intermediate calculations, leading to truncation in the division.

### Attack Path

1. A user redeems leverage tokens (TokenType.LEVERAGE) using the getRedeemAmount function with valid inputs for depositAmount, bondSupply, levSupply, and poolReserves.
2. The collateralLevel is calculated based on the tvl, bondSupply, and other inputs.
If collateralLevel > COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD, the redeemRate is calculated using the flawed formula: ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION.
3. Integer division truncates the intermediate result of ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply), resulting in an inaccurate redeemRate. The final redeem amount (depositAmount * redeemRate) becomes incorrect due to the imprecise redeemRate

### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss due to the incorrect calculation of the redeem amount, leading to under-compensation for their redeemed leverage tokens. The protocol risks user trust and financial stability due to imprecise token redemption.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace:
```diff
- redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
+ redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / assetSupply;
```
