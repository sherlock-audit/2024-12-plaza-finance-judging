# Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) Interval Cannot Be Modified After Deployment

### Summary
The `BondOracleAdapter` contract's `twapInterval` is immutable after initialization, preventing any adjustments to the TWAP calculation period even if market conditions or protocol requirements change. This lack of flexibility could impact the oracle's ability to provide optimal price data.

### Vulnerability Details
The `BondOracleAdapter` contract uses [TWAP](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L24) calculations to provide price data for bonds. The TWAP interval is set during initialization:

```solidity
uint32 public twapInterval;

function initialize(
    address _bondToken,
    address _liquidityToken,
    uint32 _twapInterval,
    address _dexFactory,
    address _owner
) external initializer {
    ...
    twapInterval = _twapInterval;
    ...
}
```

This interval is then used in `latestRoundData()` to calculate prices:

```solidity
function latestRoundData() external view returns (...) {
    uint32[] memory secondsAgos = new uint32[](2);
    secondsAgos[0] = twapInterval; // from (before)
    secondsAgos[1] = 0; // to (now)
    
    (int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = ICLPool(dexPool).observe(secondsAgos);
    ...
}
```

However, there is no mechanism to modify this interval after deployment, making the contract inflexible to changing market conditions or in the case of anything that could happen in the future related to the twap.

### POC
1. Contract is deployed with `twapInterval` set to 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
2. Market conditions change, becoming more volatile
3. Protocol determines a shorter TWAP interval (e.g., 900 seconds) would provide more accurate pricing
4. No way to adjust the interval without deploying a new contract
5. Protocol is forced to continue using potentially suboptimal 30-minute TWAP or redeploy the entire oracle

### Impact
- Unable to adjust TWAP periods to respond to market volatility
- Potential need for contract redeployment if TWAP interval becomes inappropriate

### Mitigation
Add a setter function with appropriate access control to modify the TWAP interval:

```solidity
// Add event for tracking changes
event TwapIntervalUpdated(uint32 oldInterval, uint32 newInterval);

// Add setter with access control
function setTwapInterval(uint32 _newInterval) external onlyOwner {
    require(_newInterval > 0, "Invalid interval");
    // Optional: Add upper bound
    require(_newInterval <= 24 hours, "Interval too long");
    
    uint32 oldInterval = twapInterval;
    twapInterval = _newInterval;
    emit TwapIntervalUpdated(oldInterval, _newInterval);
}
```
