# Protocol fee is charged even when protocol is paused

### Summary

Users forced to pay protocol fee when protocol is paused.

### Root Cause

In plaza pool, fee is taken base on how much time passed:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L718-#L720

  function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }

But it have `whenNotPaused` modifier in multiple functions in the contract. Users couldn't have withdrawn during this period but are still forced to pay the fee.
