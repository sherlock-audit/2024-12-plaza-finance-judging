# Lack of Slippage Control During Balancer Pool Joins in joinBalancerAndPredeposit

### Summary

The function `joinBalancerAndPredeposit()` in BalancerRouter.sol joins a Balancer pool and deposits the received pool tokens into a PreDeposit contract. However, the function does not implement slippage control to ensure a minimum expected amount of balancerPoolTokenReceived. This oversight could lead to situations where users receive fewer pool tokens than expected, potentially resulting in financial loss.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L31

`BalancerRouter.sol::joinBalancerAndPredeposit()`:-

```javascript
    function joinBalancerAndPredeposit(
        bytes32 balancerPoolId,
        address _predeposit,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
@>      uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = joinBalancerPool(balancerPoolId, assets, maxAmountsIn, userData);
        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(_predeposit, balancerPoolTokenReceived);
        PreDeposit(_predeposit).deposit(balancerPoolTokenReceived, msg.sender);
        return balancerPoolTokenReceived;
    }
```

When joining Balancer pool with assets to get Pool tokens it is not checking for slippage. Because of which users may deposit less pool token than expected.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The function interacts with a Balancer pool through joinBalancerPool() to exchange assets for pool tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

The pool’s token price may fluctuate based on the pool’s liquidity and market conditions.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users could receive fewer pool tokens than expected due to slippage during the pool join operation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a slippage check in joinBalancerAndPredeposit() to ensure the balancerPoolTokenReceived meets a minimum threshold specified by the user.
