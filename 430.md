# Attacker can steal coupon distributions from bondETH holders

### Summary

When an auction ends successfully, coupons are sent  to `Distributor.sol` for distribution to bondETH holders. When a bondETH holder calls `claim()` to claim their distribution, the amount of shares (i.e. coupons) to send to the call is calculated by `bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount`. The problem is that the current balance of the user is passed in as a parameter, rather than the users balance at the end of the previous distribution period:

```solidity
function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
...
// @audit gets msg.sender's current balance rather than their balance when the distribution period ended.
@>  uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
@>  uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

...
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
    
...
  }

```

An attacker could create or purchase a large amount of bondETH right as the auction is ending, call `Distributor::distribute()` and then `Distributor::claim()` immediately after, allowing them to claim a larger portion or all of the coupons for the previous distribution period.

### Root Cause

In `Distributor::claim()`, the current balance of the user is passed in as a parameter to `bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount()`, rather than the users balance at the end of the previous distribution period.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker monitors when an auction is about to conclude.
2. Right before the auction ends, the attacker acquires a large amount of bondETH.
3. The attacker calls endAuction(), distribute(), and then claim(). Because bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender) is used instead of a users balance at the end of the previous distribution period, they receive a disproportionate share (or all) of the coupons for the past distribution period.

### Impact

Loss of funds for bondETH holders

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

During claim(), get the msg.sender's balance at the end of the previous distribution period.
