# Lack of slippage check in BalancerRounter::joinBalancerPool will make users experience slippage loss

### Summary

There is no slippage check to protect users from slippage loss when joining balancer pool.

### Root Cause

In `BalancerRouter.sol:89`, the code immediately returns the BPT token difference after joining pool without checking if users are OK with that amount
