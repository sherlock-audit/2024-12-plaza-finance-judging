# Missing Distribution Period Check in `distribute()` Function

### Summary

The `distribute()` function in the contract does not check if the distribution period has passed before allowing the function to execute, contrary to the stated purpose in its documentation comment. This could result in premature execution of the function and mismanagement of the distribution process.

### Root Cause

- The function documentation explicitly states that the distribution should only occur "after the distribution period has passed."
- However, there is no explicit check in the function to ensure that the current time is beyond the distribution deadline.
- This mismatch between the documentation and the implementation could lead to:

    - Premature execution of the `distribute()` function.
    - Mismanagement of the distribution process, affecting user trust and protocol integrity.

### Attack Path

1. Call the `distribute()` function without any prior condition checking for the distribution period.
2. Observe that the function executes even if the distribution period has not passed.

### Impact

- Premature execution could lead to distribution of tokens before an auction's completion or the intended period, resulting in financial loss or unfair distribution.
- Alignment of code behavior with documentation is critical to avoid misuse and misinterpretation by integrators.

### Mitigation

**Proposed Fix:**

Introduce a check to ensure that the current block timestamp is beyond the distribution period before allowing the function to execute.

**Example Fix:**

```solidity

 function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
        
        require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod < block.timestamp, DistributionPeriodNotPassed());
        (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
        require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());

        // Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
        uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
        uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();
 
        if (
            Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT
                || Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD
        ) {
            emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
            return;
        }

        // Get Distributor
        address distributor = poolFactory.distributors(address(this));

        // Transfer coupon tokens to the distributor
        IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(distributor, couponAmountToDistribute);

        // Update distributor with the amount to distribute
        Distributor(distributor).allocate(couponAmountToDistribute);
       

        emit Distributed(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute, distributor);
    }
```
