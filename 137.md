# Wrong fee logic will lead to revenue loss

### Summary

The current fee logic is wrong as it may not take the correct amount of fee leading to revenue loss for the protocol.

### Root Cause

In the current logic the fee is taken the following way:
```solidity
 function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
        return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime))
            / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
    }
```

This allows the feeBeneficiary to claim their fee as it is accrued with time. This however is wrong as using this logic will get more fee then it actually should, causing a loss for users.
Consider the following scenario:
We have reserveAmount = 100e18, fee = 100000(10%)
The fee for one year is expected to be:
10%*100e18 = 10e18
However if the fee beneficiary claims the fee two times: 
- First claim will be on day 182(almost exactly 50%) the claimed fee will be:
182/365*10%*100e18 = 4.98e18
After that the fee is transferred to the fee beneficiary so the reserveAmount is 95.02e18
-Second claim is on day 365
the fee will now be:
183/365*10%*95.02e18 =4.76
The total fees claimed are 9.74e18 instead of 10e18 which means that the protocol will suffer a revenue loss because of this incorrect fee logic.
