# Title: Precision Loss in claim() Function Calculation

### Summary

The `claim()` function in the `preDeposit` contract performs calculations that involve division, leading to potential precision loss due to truncation. The use of integer division could cause small errors when calculating user shares of bond and leverage tokens. This can lead to discrepancies in the amount transferred to users, especially when dealing with small or large values.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L163-L185

Vulnerable Code:
`uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
uint256 userLeverageShare = (leverageAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;`

when `(bondAmount * userBalance)` is less than `reserveAmount` the user recieves Zero Bond shares, and the same goes for the leverage shares. Also Even for `(bondAmount * userBalance)` > `reserveAmount` a greate amount of shares a lost to truncation

### Impact

### Severity: High
**Category:** Calculation Error, Precision Loss
**Effect:** Users may receive incorrect amounts of bond and leverage tokens due to truncation errors in division which leads to loss of users funds.
**Risk:** Over time, the cumulative effect could lead to significant errors in token distribution and user claims, affecting the protocolâ€™s fairness.

### Mitigation

**1** Use Safe Multiplication and Scaling: Scale the intermediate results before performing the division to avoid truncation errors:

`uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance * 1e18) / reserveAmount;
uint256 userLeverageShare = (leverageAmount * userBalance * 1e18) / reserveAmount;`
// Optionally, scale back if necessary
`userBondShare = userBondShare / 1e18;
userLeverageShare = userLeverageShare / 1e18;`

**2** Add Precision Checks: Ensure that the scaling factor chosen (e.g., 1e18) is appropriate for the expected precision in the contract. This avoids significant precision loss for small values.

**3** Test with Edge Cases: Test the contract with a variety of bondAmount, reserveAmount, and userBalance values to ensure that truncation does not affect fairness.
