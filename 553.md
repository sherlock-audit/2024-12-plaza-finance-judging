# SECURITY_COUNCIL_ROLE will be unable to pause the BalancerOracleAdapter, exposing it to attacks or misbehavior

### Summary

[The `BalancerOracleAdapter` contract inherits the `PausableUpgradeable`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol#L18), which allows the contract to enter a paused state in case of emergencies or undesired behavior. However, it does not expose external `pause()` and `unpause()` functions, which are necessary for authorized actors to trigger these states. As a result, the protocol cannot be paused in adverse situations, defeating the purpose of implementing the `PausableUpgradeable` functionality.


### Root Cause

The `pause()` and `unpause()` functions required to utilize the `PausableUpgradeable` functionality are not implemented as external functions in the `BalancerOracleAdapter` contract. Without these, the `PausableUpgradeable` feature becomes effectively inaccessible.

NOTE that the [BondOracleAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol) has the same issue
### Internal Pre-conditions

1. SECURITY_COUNCIL_ROLE needs to pause `BalancerOracleAdapter` contract.
2. He tries to call pause() function but he realizes that there is no such function and the contract cannot be paused

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The protocol faces an unexpected vulnerability, such as incorrect price calculation or manipulation.
2. The SECURITY_COUNCIL_ROLE attempts to pause the protocol to mitigate damage and safeguard funds.
3. Since the contract does not expose `pause()` or `unpause()` functions, it cannot be paused, leaving the protocol vulnerable to ongoing exploitation.

### Impact

The protocol suffers the inability to respond to emergencies by pausing operations.

- Affected party: The protocol and its users.
- Loss: This depends on the severity of the exploit or misbehavior occurring during the unpausable period.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the following external functions to the `BalancerOracleAdapter` contract:

```solidity 
function pause() external onlySecurityCouncil {
    _pause();
}

function unpause() external onlySecurityCouncil {
    _unpause();
}
```
