# Incorrect price handling in `BondOracleAdapter` contract

### Summary

In `BondOracleAdapter` contract, it returns price of `BondToken` using TWAP oracle of Aerodrome's concentrated liquidity pools, which uses Uniswap V3's price calculation mechanism. However, it does not handle the price calculation correctly, thus it only works when `BondToken` is `token0` and `Liquidity Token` is `token1` of the CL pool, both with 18 decimals.

It does not work when `BondToken` is `token1` of the CL pool, because the price returned is the price of `Liquidity Token` against `BondToken`, which means $ \frac{1}{Price} $.

In addition, it does not handle different token decimals either, which returns unexpected token price.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in `lastRoundData` function on [BondOracleAdapter.sol#L99-L114](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/,2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L99-L114), where it only calculates price by squaring `sqrtPriceX96` without accounting the order of tokens in the CL pool.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `OracleFeeds` contract uses `BondOracleAdapter` to calculate the price of Bond Token.

### External Pre-conditions

- In `Aerodrome` CL pool, the bond token is `token1`, the liquidity token is `token0`.

### Attack Path

- Since the price returned from `BondOracleAdapter` is $ \frac {1} {Price} $, the price of `wstETH` for example, will be `1 / 3900` USD.
- Users create/redeem very little amount of bond tokens than they deserve, or the whole mechanism does not work because of minimum bond token amount mechanism.

### Impact

- Incorrect price from the oracle breaks the whole pricing mechanism of the bonding protocol.
- Users do not create or redeem correct amounts of Bond Tokens.

### PoC

To demonstrate the issue, I've written a test case using Foundry below:

- It forks from Base network, to easily work with live Aerodrome protocol.
- `wstETH / USDC` CL pool is used for the test, where `wstETH` is `token1` of the pool.

    function testBondTokenPrice() public {
        BondOracleAdapter adapter = BondOracleAdapter(Utils.deploy(
            address(new BondOracleAdapter()),
            abi.encodeCall(BondOracleAdapter.initialize, (
                bondToken,
                liquidityToken,
                3600, // 1 hour
                factory,
                address(1)
            ))
        ));

        (,int256 answer,,,) = adapter.latestRoundData();

        console.log("--- Bond Token Price --- ");
        console.log(answer);
        console.log("--- Bond Token Decimals ---");
        console.log(adapter.decimals());
    }
}
```

Run the test case using the command below, replacing `{{RPC_URL}}` with working Base RPC:

```bash
forge test --match-test testBondTokenPrice -vv --fork-url {{RPC_URL}}
```

Here's the output of the test:

```bash
Ran 1 test for test/AuditBondOracleAdapter.t.sol:AuditBondOracleAdapter
[PASS] testBondTokenPrice() (gas: 3508416)
Logs:
  --- Bond Token Price --- 
  18876194167075133461674996703661467841
  --- Bond Token Decimals ---
  18

Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 8.73s (5.86s CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 10.46s (8.73s CPU time): 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

As shown in the test output, the price of `wstETH` returned is `18876194167075133461.674996703661467841 USDC` which is pretty huge amount, this happens because of both token order and token decimals.

### Mitigation

The price calculation mechanism should be modified to handle token ordering and decimals correctly.
