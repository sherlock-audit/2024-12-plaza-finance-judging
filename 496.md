# Precision loss in `getRedeemAmount` function

### Summary

The function `getRedeemAmount` has precision-loss issue
when calculating the redeem amount, potentially making the redeem amount end up as zero. First reason is because
converting `ethPrice` to base units is completed when calculating the `tvl`, and the other is because
PRECISION is multiplied after division when calculating the `redeemRate`. It was an issue reported by Zellic team, but still not fix in the current audit contest.

### Root Cause

1. Conversion of `ethPrice` to base units when calculating `tvl`
2. Performing division before multiplication, which could end up 0.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `getRedeemAmount` will end up returning 0, which will cause the `redeem` function to revert because of this line.
```solidity
    if (reserveAmount == 0) {
      revert ZeroAmount();
    }
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Multiplication should always be performed before division to avoid loss of precision. Also, consider
performing the conversion of `ethPrice` during the calculation of the redeem
amount.
