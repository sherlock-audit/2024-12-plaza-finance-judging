# Period Mismatch in Pool-Auction Interaction Will Prevent Reserve Transfer for Successful Auctions

### Summary

The mismatch between auction periods and pool periods will cause successful auctions to fail when attempting to transfer reserve tokens   (eg.wstETH) from the pool. When an auction is created, it's stored at `currentPeriod` but this period is immediately incremented, causing the auction's attempt to get reserves upon successful completion to fail.


### Root Cause

In Pool.sol, [startAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L567) creates new auction and immediately increments currentPeriod:

```solidity
// Deploy auction at current period
auctions[currentPeriod] = deployAuction();
// Increment period
bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);
// currentPeriod is now N+1
```

When auction succeeds and ends , this will call the [transferReserveToAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L345) from Pool contract.

```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
@>    Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

However, this checks the address of the [`auctions[currentPeriod]`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L579-L580) which was already incremented during the start of the auction.

```solidity
function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];  // Checks period N+1
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, "CallerIsNotAuction");
    // Auction is actually at period N, so this always fails
}
```




### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. StartAuction() creates auction at period N
2. Period immediately increments to N+1
3. Auction accumulates enough bids and meets conditions to succeed
4. endAuction() marks state as SUCCEEDED
5. Attempts to get reserves via transferReserveToAuction()
6. Check fails because auction is looking at wrong period
7. Entire endAuction() transaction reverts

### Impact

Successful auctions cannot retrieve Reserves from pool & Coupon Tokens (USDC) cannot be distributed to bondETH holders. Breaking the core functionality of a successful auction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check previous period in transferReserveToAuction:

```diff
function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
-   address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
+   address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod - 1];
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, "CallerIsNotAuction");
}
```
