# `Auction.bid` doesn't check min limit of `sellCouponAmount/buyReserveAmount`

### Summary

In `Auction` contract, `bid` function doesn't check min limit of `sellCouponAmount/buyReserveAmount`.
Even though it became lowest bid, if `buyReserveAmount` is big enough and that bid doesn't removed by another bid, malicious user can get too many reserve token from pool.
This is auction and reserve token is not NFT.
It is ether-tokens and users can get oracle price of those so users bid with `sellCouponAmount/buyReserveAmount` that is better than oracle price for bidder.
It means auction bidders get benefit than oracle price.
BondToken holders gets couponTokens from distribution but it came from auctioned reserve token that sold by cheaper price than oracle price.
This auction is repeated and pool has not enough reserve tokens and bondToken holders will get small reserve tokens than expected.
So bondToken and leverageToken holders can't get benefit.
Minimum limit of `sellCouponAmount/buyReserveAmount` must be checked and prevent bad ratio by using oracle price.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L126-L129

This doesn't check minimum limit of `sellCouponAmount/buyReserveAmount` and this causes malicious user can get too many reserve tokens from pool using auction.
