# Users may not be able to claim their coupons in some cases

### Summary

The current design of how bonds are acquired has some flaws that will result in users being unable to claim their bonds.
In order to gather funds to satisfy bond holders an auction is made to sell some of the reserve token to buy coupon tokens. The `startAuction` function will instantly update the period. It will instantly [increment the period](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L567C15-L567C41). However users will be able to instantly claim coupons from the `Distributor.sol` `claim` function without waiting for the auction to succeed. This will create issues for some users to claim their coupons if others call claim before the auction is succeeded and funds are transferred to the `Distributor.sol`. Furthermore if the auction does not succeed there will be insolvency as some users will have already claimed.


### Root Cause

Users can claim for a period before an auction succeeds.

### Attack Path

1. Bob and Alice both own 1 BOND token each `currentPeriod = 0`
2. An auction is started and is successful. Now there are 5 USDC in the distributor contract.  `currentPeriod = 1`
3. Only Bob will call claim and receive his 2.5 USDC.
4. Another auction is started `currentPeriod = 2`
5. Bob instantly calls claim again and receives another 2.5USDC for period 1
6. The auction however does not manage to sell the required tokens and fails.
7. Now Alice will be unable to withdraw her 2.5 tokens for period 0 because the distributor contract will not have enough funds.

### Impact

Insolvency in the `Distributor.sol`
