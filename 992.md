# `Pool:distribute` can be called in any moment


## Summary
`Pool:distribute` can be called any time even if the state of the auction is `BIDDING` which would cause to start the distribution of the `couponToken` for the `auctions[previousPeriod]`. This without knowing if that auction will fail. 

## Relevant GitHub Links 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589-L614

## Root Cause
`Pool:distribute` does not have a `require` statement that checks if the auction is in a `Auction.State.BIDDING`. This because the `auction[prevoiusPeriod]` could not be ended when the `Pool:distribute` is called, due to the fact that the `currentPeriod` is increased when the new auction is created and not when the `Auction::endAuction` function is called. 

## Internal Pre-conditions
The `Pool.sol` has balance of `couponToken` that is `>0` (it could derive from previous coupon not distributed since the `Pool::distribute` function could potentially not be called at all after an auction)
`currentPeriod == x`
A new auction is created `currentPeriod=x+1` 
The new auction is still in the state `BIDDING`.

## External Pre-conditions
None.

## Attack Path
Someone call the `Pool:distribution` while the new auction `auctions[prevousperiod]` is in the state `BIDDING` and the distribution of the coupons start without knowing the final state of the auction

## Impact
Calling the `Pool::distribute` when the auction is in the `BIDDING` state could imply to wrongly distribute the `couponTokens` to all the `bondToken` holders (this because befroe knowing the final state of the auction and the right amount of `auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount()`).

## Mitigation
Write a new modifier to run the function only when the auction and distribution periods have passed. 
Another possible solution could be: 

```diff
  function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());

    // Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();

    if (Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT ||
        Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD
+       ||Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.BIDDING
        ) 
        
        {

      emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
      return;
    }

    // Get Distributor
    address distributor = poolFactory.distributors(address(this));

    // Transfer coupon tokens to the distributor
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(distributor, couponAmountToDistribute);

    // Update distributor with the amount to distribute
    Distributor(distributor).allocate(couponAmountToDistribute);

    emit Distributed(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute, distributor);
  }
```
