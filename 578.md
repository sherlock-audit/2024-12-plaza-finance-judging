# In both the `Auction` and `Distributor` contracts, there is an issue with unclaimed rewards.

### Summary

1. **Auction Contract**:
   - Scenario: A user participates in the auction by depositing USDC to receive `wstETH`. If the user wins the auction but fails to claim their `wstETH` reward (e.g., due to losing their wallet or forgetting), the reward remains locked within the contract indefinitely.

2. **Distributor Contract**:
   - Issue: Users who fail to claim their allocated share of `couponAmountToDistribute` leave unclaimed USDC trapped in the contract without a mechanism for withdrawal or redistribution.

### Root Cause

Both contracts rely on **manual claiming** of rewards instead of an automated transfer mechanism. Unclaimed rewards accumulate indefinitely due to the absence of an owner-withdraw function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `Auction` contract successfully completes an auction, marking winners eligible to claim rewards.
- The `Distributor` contract allocates tokens to users but does not distribute them automatically.
- The contracts lack `onlyOwner` or governance-controlled withdrawal functionality.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user participates in an auction or receives an allocation but fails to call `claim()` due to loss of access, forgetting, or other reasons.
- The system continues operating, leaving rewards unclaimed indefinitely.

### Attack Path

1. **Auction Contract**:
   - A user deposits USDC into the contract for bidding.
   - They win the auction and become eligible to claim `wstETH`.
   - The user does not claim the reward, leaving `wstETH` locked indefinitely.

2. **Distributor Contract**:
   - A user receives an allocation of coupon tokens.
   - They do not claim their share, resulting in trapped tokens within the contract.

### Impact


1. **Locked Tokens**:
   - Unclaimed tokens accumulate over time, leading to inaccurate system balances.
   - Large amounts of funds may become permanently inaccessible.

2. **Operational Issues**:
   - Unclaimed tokens lead to "ghost claims," continuing allocations to users who never claim their rewards.

### PoC

1. **Auction Contract**:
   ```solidity
   contract AuctionPoC {
       function simulateWinningBid() public {
           auctionContract.bid{value: 1000}(100); // User bids and wins
           // User never calls auctionContract.claim(), funds remain stuck
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Distributor Contract**:
   ```solidity
   contract DistributorPoC {
       function simulateUnclaimedCoupons() public {
           distributorContract.allocate(1000); // Allocation made
           // Users never call distributorContract.claim(), funds remain locked
       }
   }
   ```


### Mitigation

Introduce a **claim deadline** (e.g., 30 days). Unclaimed tokens after the deadline can be reclaimed by the contract.

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public lastClaimTime;
uint256 public constant CLAIM_DEADLINE = 30 days;

function claim() external {
    require(block.timestamp <= lastClaimTime[msg.sender] + CLAIM_DEADLINE, "Claim expired");

    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender);
    require(shares > 0, "No shares to claim");
    
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
    lastClaimTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;

    emit ClaimedShares(msg.sender, shares);
}
```

---

### Solution 2: Admin Reclaim Functionality
If rewards remain unclaimed for a specified period, an admin can reclaim the tokens.

```solidity
function sweepUnclaimedShares() external onlyRole(GOV_ROLE) {
    require(block.timestamp > lastClaimTime[msg.sender] + CLAIM_DEADLINE, "Claim period still active");

    uint256 unclaimedAmount = IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - couponAmountToDistribute;
    require(unclaimedAmount > 0, "No unclaimed shares");

    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(adminTreasury, unclaimedAmount);
    emit UnclaimedFundsSwept(unclaimedAmount);
}
```

---

### Solution 3: Auto-Claim on Allocation
Modify the `allocate()` function to automatically trigger claims for pending rewards.

```solidity
function allocate(uint256 _amountToDistribute) external {
    _forceClaimAllUsers(); // Ensure no pending rewards before new allocation

    couponAmountToDistribute += _amountToDistribute;
    require(IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) >= couponAmountToDistribute, "Not enough balance");
}
```
