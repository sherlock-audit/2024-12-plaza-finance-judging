# Auctions can Transfer Reserve Tokens even when the Pool is Paused

### Summary

The missing modifier in [`Pool::transferReserveToAuction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L577) will cause the Reserve Tokens to be transferred from the Pool to the Auction contract even when the Pool contract is in a paused state. 

### Root Cause

The function [`Pool::transferReserveToAuction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L577) does not have the `whenNotPaused` modifier. This makes it so that even when the pool is paused, the auction can call this function and take out the Reserve Tokens from the Pool. 

All other functions in the `Pool` that deals with changes in its balances like `create`, `redeem`, `startAuction`, and `distribute` have the `whenNotPaused` modifier. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An auction is started. 
2. The Pool contract is paused, and the auction ends OR the auction ends and the pool contract is immediately paused. 
3. The Auction contract transfers Reserve tokens from the Pool to itself, changing the state of the Pool contract in its paused state. 

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Take the situation where a `Pool` has identified a hack or a security vulnerability, and it pauses the contract to prevent any further token transfer to mitigate exploits of the contract. Since the auction contract can bypass the pause function, it will be open to risks. 

Also, the aim of a pause function is to keep the state of the Pool contract static. This loophole causes the state of the Pool contract to change. This will lead to inconsistent state management, and does not ensure system reliability. 

On top of everything, the state change (transferring Reserve Tokens from Pool to the Auction) does not happen until the auction ends. So, there will be a time delay between pausing the entire Pool contract and the inevitable transfer. The pause can happen in any moment of the auction's duration. 

### Impact

The impact will mostly be based on any future exploits or economic situations that will cause the `Security Council` to decide that the `Pool` contract needs to be paused. If any of these situations affect the Reserve Token primarily, this will further exacerbate the situation. 

### PoC

Please paste the following PoC in the `Auction.t.sol` file: 

```solidity
function test_pausedPoolReserveTokenTransfer() public {
    vm.startPrank(bidder);
    usdc.mint(bidder, 1000000000000 ether);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000000000000 ether);
    auction.bid(100000000000 ether, 1000000000000);
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    vm.prank(securityCouncil); 
    Pool(pool).pause(); 
    console.log("Pool paused"); 
    vm.stopPrank(); 

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
    
    uint house_balance_before = usdc.balanceOf(address(house)); 
    uint auction_reserve_before = weth.balanceOf(address(auction)); 

    vm.prank(pool);
    auction.endAuction();
    console.log("endAuction called and it transferred Reserved Tokens from the pool to the beneficiary"); 
    
    uint house_balance_after = usdc.balanceOf(address(house)); 
    uint auction_reserve_after = weth.balanceOf(address(auction)); 
    
    console.log("house balance change %e", house_balance_after - house_balance_before); 
    console.log("auction reserve balance change %e", auction_reserve_after - auction_reserve_before); 

    assertEq(uint256(auction.state()), uint256(Auction.State.SUCCEEDED));

    vm.expectRevert(); 
    vm.startPrank(pool);
    Pool(pool).startAuction(); 
    console.log("pool start auction reverts with FAIL: EnforcedPause()"); 
    vm.stopPrank();
  }
```

When you run the test with the following command: `forge test --mt test_pausedPoolReserveTokenTransfer -vvv`, you will get the logs as follows: 

```bash 
Logs:
  Pool paused
  endAuction called and it transferred Reserved Tokens from the pool to the beneficiary
  house balance change 1e12
  auction reserve balance change 1e29
  pool start auction reverts with FAIL: EnforcedPause()
```

We see that the auction receives `100,000,000,000e18` of reserve tokens from the pool while the pool contract is in a paused state. The pausing of the contract can happen at any stage of the auction duration (at the start, or a few minutes before the auction ending), to right before the `endAuction` function is called.
