# Discontinuity of `creationRate` and `redeemRate` of bond token could increase significant amount of reserve token.

### Summary

Malicious users may increase reserve token by creating bond token and redeeming bond tokens.


### Root Cause

In `getCreateAmount` in `Pool.sol`, the formula for calculating `creationRate`  of bond token is not continuous.
For bond token, if `collateralLevel > COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, `creationRate` is `BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION`.
But, if `collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, `creationRate` is `tvl * multiplier / bondSupply`.
And `tvl * multiplier / bondSupply<= BOND_TARGET_PRICE * bondSupply* 1.2 * multiplier / bondSupply=BOND_TARGET_PRICE * 1.2 * 0.8 * PRECISION=BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION * 0.96 < BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION`.
Similarly, in `getRedeemAmount`, the formula for calculating `redeemRate` of bond token is also not continuous.

```solidity
    uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
    uint256 collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
    uint256 creationRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;

    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }
      creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      if (assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }

      uint256 adjustedValue = tvl - (BOND_TARGET_PRICE * bondSupply);
      creationRate = (adjustedValue * PRECISION) / assetSupply;
    }
    
    return ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
```

When `collateralLevel` is close to `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD` and users can adjust `collateralLevel` to exceed or fall below this threshold. Due to the discontinuity of `creationRate` and `redeemRate`, when `collateralLevel` is close to `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, the difference between `redeemRate` and `creationRate` can be significantly larger than in normal cases. Malicious users could lower the `creationRate` by adjusting the `collateralLevel` and subsequently increase the `redeemRate` to redeem bond tokens.

Thus, a malicious user can create bond tokens with a lower `creationRate` and subsequently adjust `collateralLevel` to increase `redeemRate`. When they redeem the bond tokens, the reserve tokens will increase compared to the state before creation.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Malicious users can increase reserve tokens by creating bond tokens or leverage tokens and redeeming them.

### PoC

The discontinuity of `creationRate` and `redeemRate` indicates that there is significant potential for increasing reserve tokens.
### Mitigation

Please ensure that the calculations for `creationRate` and `redeemRate` are continuous.
