# A user having too big shares may never claim

### Summary

in `Distributor.sol`, when claim is called, the whole amount of user shares is taken into account, and if it is a big value (the user has been long in the position), the `if (couponAmountToDistribute < shares)` check will fail, until the needed coupon amount is distributed, which theoretically may not happen in the future.
