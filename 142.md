Winning Rosewood Opossum

High

# A user will be able to steal funds from the protocol by getting blacklisted

### Summary

A user will be able to create the lowest bid and secure their place in the auction, by getting blacklisted, preventing other users from bidding.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that the `_removeBid` will try to send back the user's sell tokens [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L325). However if the coupon token is USDC and the user manages to get blacklisted their `bid` will never be removed from the queue securing the deal they wanted. This could be further used to completely rob the protocol by specifying a large number of `buyReserveAmount`


### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1.The protocol will be seeking 500USDC to satisfy user's bonds 
2. A malicious user will see the offer and provide 500USDC as a `sellCouponAmount` in the bid function and provide a large number of eth for `buyReserveAmount` for example 10e18 eth
3. The user manages to get blacklisted from USDC
4. Now nobody will ever be able to replace the user's offer since `_removeBid` will always revert and `removeExcessBids` will also revert beacuse of the failed USDC transaction
5. The user will call `endAuction` and secure their earnings.

### Impact

A user will be able to sell USDC at an extremely high price robbing the protocol - High
