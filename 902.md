# `BalancerRouter.joinBalancerPool()` Doesn't Refund Remaining Tokens

### Summary

The `BalancerRouter.joinBalancerPool()` function first transfers tokens from the caller and approves them to `balancerVault`. Then, the tokens are converted to the target token through the `balancerVault.joinPool()` function. However, there is no mechanism to refund remaining tokens.

### Root Cause

The [joinBalancerPool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L65-L90) function is designed to convert some assets to a target token.

As seen at lines 73 and 74, it first transfers the required assets from the caller and then approves them to `balancerVault`. At line 86, the `balancerVault.joinPool()` function converts the assets to the target token.

However, due to fluctuations in the `Balancer` protocol, the brought assets may not be fully utilized, leading to remaining assets. Unfortunately, there is no mechanism in place to refund these remaining assets.

```solidity
  function joinBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        // Transfer assets from user to this contract
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
73          IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
74          IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]);
        }

        IVault.JoinPoolRequest memory request = IVault.JoinPoolRequest({
            assets: assets,
79          maxAmountsIn: maxAmountsIn,
            userData: userData,
            fromInternalBalance: false
        });

        // Join Balancer pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));
86      balancerVault.joinPool(poolId, address(this), address(this), request);
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        return balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter - balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore;
    }
```
