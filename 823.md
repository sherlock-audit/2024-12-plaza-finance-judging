# Redeeming from Plaza via the Router does not allow setting a deadline

### Summary

The `BalancerRouter` contract does not allow users to set the `deadline` parameter when exiting a Plaza pool, and instead calls the regular `redeem` function that doesn’t include the `deadline` parameter.

### Root Cause

Two different functions exist Plaza’s `Pool` contract to perform redemptions: a regular `redeem` function and a `redeem` function that allows to pass a `deadline` paramater (in addition to an `onBehalfOf` parameter).

The redeem function with the `deadline` will check the `deadline` against the current `block.timestamp` to ensure that the timestamp is not surpassed. This is a useful feature for users that want to prevent a pending transaction from ever being executed in the future. 

However, the `exitPlazaAndBalancer` function in `BalancerRouter` contract [calls the regular `redeem` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/ab5bbd7d54042e4444b711a32def5b639fbd63b4/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L122), instead of the one including the `deadline` parameter, which prevents users from setting the deadline when interacting with the router:

```solidity
// File: BalancerRouter.sol

function exitPlazaAndBalancer(
        bytes32 balancerPoolId,
        address _plazaPool,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256 plazaTokenAmount,
        uint256[] memory minAmountsOut,
        bytes memory userData,
        Pool.TokenType plazaTokenType,
        uint256 minbalancerPoolTokenOut
    ) external nonReentrant {
        // Step 1: Exit Plaza Pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = _exitPlazaPool(plazaTokenType, _plazaPool, plazaTokenAmount, minbalancerPoolTokenOut);

        ...
    }
    
    function _exitPlazaPool(
        Pool.TokenType tokenType,
        address _plazaPool,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        uint256 minbalancerPoolTokenOut
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
       ...

        // Exit Plaza pool
        return plazaPool.redeem(tokenType, tokenAmount, minbalancerPoolTokenOut); 
    }
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Medium, the expected functionality of being able to set a `deadline` when redeeming can’t be done in case users want to utilize the router, effectively breaking core contract functionality aiming at preventing pending transactions from being executed in the future at an undesired state.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider allowing users to specify the `deadline` when calling `exitPlazaAndBalancer`, and call the appropriate `redeem` function from the `Pool` contract.
