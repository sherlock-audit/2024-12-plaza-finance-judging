# Overestimation of from's Shares and Underestimation of to's Shares:

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154C3-L164C4

User assets were being updated using balances before the transfer, leading to inaccurate share calculations.
Users could earn more or fewer shares than they should, violating fairness and correctness.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154C3-L164C4

  function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused() {
    if (from != address(0)) {
      updateIndexedUserAssets(from, balanceOf(from));
    }


    if (to != address(0)) {
      updateIndexedUserAssets(to, balanceOf(to));
    }


    super._update(from, to, amount);
  }

  function updateIndexedUserAssets(address user, uint256 balance) internal {
    uint256 period = globalPool.currentPeriod;
    uint256 shares = getIndexedUserAmount(user, balance, period);
    
    userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares = shares;
    userAssets[user].lastUpdatedPeriod = period;


    emit UpdatedUserAssets(user, period, shares);
  }

The core issue lies in the order of operations within the _update function. Specifically, the balances used to update user assets are fetched before the token transfer has been processed, resulting in outdated balances.

The contract calls balanceOf(from) to get the balance of the from address.
At this point, the balance still includes the amount that is about to be transferred since the transfer hasn't been processed yet.
The user assets for from are updated using this outdated balance, which is higher than it should be after the transfer.

Similarly, the contract calls balanceOf(to) to get the balance of the to address.
Since the transfer hasn't been processed, the balance doesn't include the incoming amount.
The user assets for to are updated using this outdated balance, which is lower than it should be after the transfer.

Finally, super._update(from, to, amount); is called, which  process the transfer and update the balances.

### Impact

The from address is credited with shares as if they still held the tokens they just transferred. They accrue more shares than they should, given their new, lower balance.

The to address doesn't get credited with shares for the incoming tokens until the next update. They miss out on accruing shares that they should earn from their new, higher balance.
