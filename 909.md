# Malicious Users Can Disrupt Pool Creation via `PreDeposit` Contract

### Summary

In the `PreDeposit` contract, creating a pool requires that `reserveAmount` is not 0. A malicious user can exploit this.

By depositing funds until the deposit cap is reached, the malicious user can prevent others from depositing. Just before the deposit end time, the malicious user can withdraw all funds, resulting in a `reserveAmount` of 0 and preventing the owner from creating the pool.

### Root Cause

The [createPool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L150) function requires that `reserveAmount` is not 0.

By depositing the maximum limit and then withdrawing all funds just before the deposit end time, a malicious user can effectively block pool creation. Once the deposit end time is reached, the contract becomes useless.

```solidity
      function createPool() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
150     if (reserveAmount == 0) revert NoReserveAmount();
        if (bondAmount == 0 || leverageAmount == 0) revert InvalidBondOrLeverageAmount();
        if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
        IERC20(params.reserveToken).approve(address(factory), reserveAmount);
        pool = factory.createPool(params, reserveAmount, bondAmount, leverageAmount, bondName, bondSymbol, leverageName, leverageSymbol, true);

        emit PoolCreated(pool);
        poolCreated = true;
      }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Malicious users can disrupt pool creation, rendering the `PreDeposit` contract useless.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Allow the creation of a pool whenever the deposit cap is reached, even before the deposit end time. This change would prevent malicious users from blocking pool creation by withdrawing funds at the last moment.
