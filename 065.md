# An attacker can grief the auction

### Summary

The bidding mechanism in the Auction contract is flaw so that an attacker can make the auction to be failed by bidding a very large amount of buy reserve amount

### Root Cause

The [function `Auction::endAuction()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336-L350) is called after auction period to end the auction. In case the sale limit is reached, the auction is marked as failed. The sale limit is checked by compare the `totalSellReserveAmount` with adjusted pool reserve balance: `totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100`
```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
@>    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
@>        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```
However, in the [function `bid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125-L171), the `totalSellReserveAmount` can be increased arbitrarily when caller only has to send coupon token. This can allow the bidder to use a low amount of coupon token with very high amount of buy reserve amount to increase `totalSellReserveAmount`, which finally force the auction to be failed for pool sale limit. 
This attack vector is feasible because even though the attacker's bid can be the lowest bid. To decrease `totalSellReserveAmount`, it is necessary to make many bids (exceed max bids = 1000), so that the lowest can be removed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An auction starts
2. An attacker bids using large amount of `buyReserveAmount`, effectively increase `totalSellReserveAmount` to exceed pool sale limit
3. Auction ends up failed because of pool sale limi reached

### Impact

- Grief the auction process

### PoC


### Mitigation

Consider having a minimum price to bid so that a bid having low price can not be placed in the system
