# BondOracleAdapter will cause massive loss of funds for a large number of bond tokens

### Summary

BondOracleAdapter both directly returns the price from the pool and hardcodes the oracle decimals to bondToken.decimals(). The combination of these two factors will cause the adapter to return an incorrect value for any bondToken that is not alphanumerically greater than USDC. The dex pool always prices tokenA in terms of tokenB and because the decimals of the oracle are hardcoded to the decimals of the bond token, the bond token must be tokenB or else the decimals will be incorrect. This incorrect pricing will cause massive loss of funds to user withdrawing from the pool as the market price will be much too low.

When initializing the BondOracleAdapter, it pulls the pool address from the getPool mapping. While this will pull the relevant pool for those tokens, it does not ensure that the tokens are in the correct order.

[CLFactory.sol#L91-L93](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/7b50de4648ec340891a8d5c1366c83983308d3b9/contracts/core/CLFactory.sol#L91-L93)

        getPool[token0][token1][tickSpacing] = pool;
        // populate mapping in the reverse direction, deliberate choice to avoid the cost of comparing addresses
        getPool[token1][token0][tickSpacing] = pool;

We see that get pool is populated in both orders even though they are sorted alphanumerically. Therefore when the pool is retrieved for BondOracleAdapter the tokens can be in any order.

[BondOracleAdapter#L113](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L113)

    return (uint80(0), int256(getPriceX96FromSqrtPriceX96(getSqrtTwapX96)), block.timestamp, block.timestamp, uint80(0));

We see that when price is returned it is always returned directly as returned by the underlying dex pool. The issues is that if the bond token is not tokenB then the decimal of the return value will be the liquidity token rather than the bond token.

[Pool.sol#L519-L521](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L519-L521)

    if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
      redeemRate = marketRate;
    }

As a result when redeeming bond tokens the value will be significantly lower than expected and will result in bond holders losing large amounts of value.

### Root Cause

[BondOracleAdapter#L113](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L113) always return price directly

[BondOracleAdapter.sol#L62](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L62) always assumes that price is denominated in bond tokens

### Internal Pre-conditions

address(bondToken) > address(liquidityToken)

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Loss of funds for redeeming bond token holders

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

BondOracleAdapter#initialize should set decimals to either bondToken or liquidityToken depending on token order in the pool
