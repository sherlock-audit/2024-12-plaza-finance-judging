# Malicious actor can drain `Distributor` by stealing coupon tokens

### Summary

An attacker can steal funds using `Distributor::claim` function because of wrong logic implementation in `BondToken::getIndexedUserAmount` function, that is used to calculate the `shares`.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
@>      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
 }
```

When a user buys derivative bondTokens using `Pool::create` function, then `bondTokens` are minted for the recipient. In `BondToken` the standard ERC20 [`_update`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154C1-L164C4) function is overridden which internally calls [`updateIndexedUserAssets`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L172C1-L180C4) function, that adds a `IndexedUserAssets` struct to `BondToken::userAssets` array for the current user. 

This mechanism entitles the user to claim `couponToken` proceeds from auctions in future periods. While calculating shares, the user will receive the accumulated shares, for each `period` (from lastUpdatedPeriod to currentPeriod), based upon the `balance` of `bondTokens` held by the user and the `sharesPerToken` for each respective `period`.

### Root Cause

The problem arises, when user calls `Distributor::claim` function, which further calls `BondToken::getIndexedUserAmount` function and passes user's current balance as parameter

```solidity
function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    ....
@>  uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
@>  uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
    ....
}
```

In `BondToken::getIndexedUserAmount` function, the shares are calculated based on this current balance

```solidity
for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
@>      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
 }
```

This logic allows an attacker to manipulate the `shares` by buying a large amount of bond tokens, just before claiming the coupon tokens, in order to increase the current balance, which will further give him extra tokens for each period because of artificially inflated `balance`. Immediately after claiming extra share he can again sell(redeem) those large amount of bond tokens.

The attack cost is nominal because user will only bear the transaction cost because he can arrange a large flashloan to execute all this in a single transaction. There is no time lag implemented.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There is distributable coupon tokens in `Distributor`

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker has legitimately bought even a very nominal amount of bond tokens before the auction, making him entitled to claims

### Attack Path

1. Attacker buys a very nominal amount of bond tokens
2. Attacker wait for some auctions to complete successfully
3. When there is good amount of tokens in `Distributor` ready to be claimed
4. Attacker externally takes a flashloan of reserveTokens, buys bondTokens, claims the coupon tokens, redeems the bond tokens, pays back the flashloan and pockets the stolen coupon tokens

### Impact

Distributor smart contract can be drained maliciously by an attacker.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of using the user's current balance at the time of claim, we need to checkpoint the user's balance for each period and use time weighted average balance while proportionating the share to claim.
