# Inaccurate Share Distribution Due to Premature Bond/Leverage Amount Setting

### Summary
The [PreDeposit.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L204), The choice to set `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount` before the deposit period ends will cause inaccurate share distribution for depositors as the final `reserveAmount` may change after the amounts are set so these values directly affect share calculations that depend on the final `reserveAmount`.

### Root Cause
The choice to enforce setting `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount` before deposit end through the `checkDepositNotEnded` modifier will prevents the owner from setting accurate token amounts based on final total deposits:
```solidity
  function setBondAndLeverageAmount(uint256 _bondAmount, uint256 _leverageAmount) external onlyOwner checkDepositNotEnded {
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();

    bondAmount = _bondAmount;
    leverageAmount = _leverageAmount;
  }
```
Timing and Information Availability:
```solidity
function claim() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
++    // User shares are calculated based on final amounts
    uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
    uint256 userLeverageShare = (leverageAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
}
```
Current Implementation Issues:
The owner must set amounts BEFORE deposit ends:
```solidity
  function _deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) private checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
++ // reserve can only be determine when deposit has ended
    balances[recipient] += amount;
    reserveAmount += amount;

    IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    emit Deposited(recipient, amount);
  }
```
This means setting amounts without knowing final total deposits (reserveAmount)

### Internal Pre-conditions
Owner needs to call `setBondAndLeverageAmount()` to set `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount` before deposit period ends
Total reserveAmount needs to accumulate deposits from multiple users


### Impact
Inaccurate Share Calculation: If the bondAmount and leverageAmount are set before the deposit period ends, the calculated shares (userBondShare and userLeverageShare) may not accurately reflect the final reserveAmount when it did not meet the reserveCap which is expected.

### Mitigation
Add `checkDepositEnded` modifier instead to ensure amounts are set after total deposits are known
```solidity
function setBondAndLeverageAmount(uint256 _bondAmount, uint256 _leverageAmount) external onlyOwner checkDepositEnded {
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();

    bondAmount = _bondAmount;
    leverageAmount = _leverageAmount;
}
```

Or Remove `checkDepositNotEnded` modifier from `setBondAndLeverageAmount()`
