# `PreDeposit::createPool ERC20 approve missing return value could cause DOS

### Summary

The `createPool` function performs an ERC20.approve() call but does not check the success return value.
Some tokens do not revert if the approval failed but return false instead, which means it can silently fail.

### Root Cause

If the reserve token is a non-ERC20 standard token, the ERC20.approve() in the `createPool` can silently fail and prevent newly created pool from being seeded with underlying asset due to missing checks

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The reserve token approve fails

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the transfer of the reserve token approve fails, the newly created pool does not get seeded with underlying asset, which potentially lead to DOS of being able to create pool from `PreDeposit.sol`

### PoC

### Mitigation

I recommend using [OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.1/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L74) versions with the safeApprove function that handles the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
