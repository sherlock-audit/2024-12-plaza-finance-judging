## Root Cause
The `auctionPeriod` is not initialized on the creation of a Pool. This will allow user to create new auctions with `auctionPeriod==0` because `0` is the `default value`.

## Internal Pre-conditions
`auctionPeriod` not initialized using the dedicated function (`auctionPeriod==0`)
## External Pre-conditions
None.
## Attack Path
User create an auction with a `0s` duration 

## Impact
Users can create auctions with no duration because is `auctionPeriod==0`.


## Mitigation
Initialize the `auctionPeriod` variable in the `Poool::initialize` function
