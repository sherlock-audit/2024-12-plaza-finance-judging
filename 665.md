# Incorrect Balance Update for Share Calculation in `_update` Method lead to Token Receivers Loss Rewards

### Summary

The `_update` function updates user asset indices before executing the actual token transfer of `super._update(from, to, amount)`. This leads to a timing issue where the balance data used for updates (`balanceOf`) reflects the state before the transfer, resulting in incorrect updates to indexed user shares. This issue can lead to inconsistencies in the accounting system and misrepresentation of user balances or rewards.

### Root Cause

The function calls `updateIndexedUserAssets` using `balanceOf(from)` and `balanceOf(to)` before the transfer of `super._update(from, to, amount)` occurs. Since the balances haven't been updated yet, the calculations are based on outdated data.

**Relevant Code**  
[plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol:_update#L154-L164](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154C1-L164C4)
The following code snippet demonstrates the issue:  
```solidity
function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
    // @audit Update `from` address's assets before the transfer
    if (from != address(0)) {
        updateIndexedUserAssets(from, balanceOf(from));
    }

    // @audit Update `to` address's assets before the transfer
    if (to != address(0)) {
        updateIndexedUserAssets(to, balanceOf(to));
    }

    // @audit Perform the actual transfer
    super._update(from, to, amount);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `updateIndexedUserAssets` relies on the result of `balanceOf` to update user assets.
2. The transfer logic (`super._update`) alters the balances of `from` and `to`.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users initiate transfers involving an update to their indexed assets.
2. The system assumes that balances used for asset calculations are correct and up-to-date.

### Attack Path

1. **Setup**: A user with outdated indexed assets initiates a transfer.  
2. **Timing Issue**: The system calculates updates to user shares using incorrect pre-transfer balances.  
3. **Exploit**: The incorrect balance data may allow users to gain unearned rewards, miss deductions, or cause reward losses for token receivers.  
4. **Outcome**: The state of user shares indices diverges from the actual balances, potentially leading to financial imbalances or unfair outcomes.

### Impact

1. **Incorrect Accounting**: User asset indices may not accurately reflect their actual balances.  
2. **Reward Misallocation**: Users may receive rewards based on outdated or incorrect balances, resulting in potential losses. Specifically, the `from` address might have an inflated share, while the `to` address experiences a reduced share, which contradicts the actual balance updates.
3. **System Inconsistency**: Long-term inconsistencies in asset indices could destabilize dependent systems or protocols.  

### PoC

1. Assume the following initial balances:  
   - `User A` (from): 100 tokens  
   - `User B` (to): 50 tokens  

2. `User A` initiates a transfer of 20 tokens to `User B`.  

3. Execution flow in `_update`, if if sharesPerToken is 1:  
   1) `updateIndexedUserAssets(from, balanceOf(from))`: 
        - Uses `balanceOf(from) = 100` (outdated) 
        - `userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares = 100` (outdated) 
       
   2) `updateIndexedUserAssets(to, balanceOf(to))`: 
        - Uses `balanceOf(to) = 50` (outdated)  
        - `userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares = 50` (outdated) 
       
   3)  `super._update(from, to, amount)`: Updates balances:  
        - `balanceOf(from) = 80`  
        - `balanceOf(to) = 70`  

4. The indexed assets of shares for both users are now inconsistent with their actual balances.

### Mitigation

The function should perform the balance update (`super._update`) first, ensuring that `balanceOf` returns the correct post-transfer balances:  
```solidity
function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
    // @audit Perform the actual transfer first
    super._update(from, to, amount);

    // @audit Update `from` address's assets after the transfer
    if (from != address(0)) {
        updateIndexedUserAssets(from, balanceOf(from));
    }

    // @audit Update `to` address's assets after the transfer
    if (to != address(0)) {
        updateIndexedUserAssets(to, balanceOf(to));
    }
}
```
