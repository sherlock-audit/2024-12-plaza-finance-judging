# Auction can have inconsistent sale limit with Pool

### Summary

The approach to track sale limit in Auction contract and Pool contract can cause the Auction to have inconsistent sale limit, resulting Auction to be failed/succeeded unexpectedly

### Root Cause

The function [`Pool::startAuction()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530-L571) starts an auction with the current `poolSaleLimit` setting.
```solidity
  function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
    ...

    auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
      address(new Auction()),
      abi.encodeWithSelector(
        Auction.initialize.selector,
        address(couponToken),
        address(reserveToken),
        couponAmountToDistribute,
        block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
        1000,
        address(this),
@>        poolSaleLimit
      )
    );
``` 
During the auction period, the setting `poolSaleLimit` can be updated by gov through the function `Pool::setPoolSaleLimit()` and this new pool sale limit will be different from the sale limit set in the ongoing auction. This discrepancy can cause the auction to end in unexpected result. 
For example, when the current pool sale limit is 90%, fee = 0%, an auction started. During auction, pool sale limit is updated to 93% in contract `Pool`, meaning that sale limit is increased. But the pool sale limit tracked by `Auction` contract is still 90%. When the auction ends, with sale amount in range [90%, 92%], the auction still fails due to sale limit but it is expected to be succeeded with the new pool limit 93%

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Pool sale limit set to 90% in Pool contract
2. Auction started
3. During the auction, Gov calls Pool contract to update pool sale limit to 95%
4. Auction period passes, total sale amount is up to 93% and the auction ended as failed due to sale limit reached.

### Impact

- Auction end state will not be as expected

### Mitigation

Consider tracking `poolSaleLimit` consistently between `Pool` contract and `Auction` contract
