# There is no validation about `reserveAmount` while creating pool.

## Summary

There is pre-deposit mechanism and users pre-deposit reserve tokens. After the pool is created, the users can get Bond and Leverage tokens.

The `reserveAmount` can be dust or a very small amount by two ways. First is that the malicious user can exploit this mechanism, and second is that users don't pre-deposit.

The problem arises while creating a pool. There is only a check whether `reserveAmount` is not 0, and a fixed amount of bond token and leverage token is minted.

In case of `reserveAmount` is dust, this could make the pool insolvent.

## Root Cause

In the [PreDeposit.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L118C1-L134C4) :: `_deposit()` function, there is check for the `reserveAmount` is reached `reserveCap`. When attacker deposits `reserveCap` amount of reserve token, the users could be DOS for pre-depositing.

```solidity
  function _deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) private checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
@>  if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached();

    address recipient = onBehalfOf == address(0) ? msg.sender : onBehalfOf;

    // if user would like to put more than available in cap, fill the rest up to cap and add that to reserves
    if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
      amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
    }

    balances[recipient] += amount;
    reserveAmount += amount;

    IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    emit Deposited(recipient, amount);
  }
```
Just before the `depositEndTime`, the attacker withdraw reserve tokens remaining dust amount of reserve tokens to the pool and invoke `createPool()`. In this case `reserveAmount` is dust.

```solidity
  function createPool() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (reserveAmount == 0) revert NoReserveAmount();
    if (bondAmount == 0 || leverageAmount == 0) revert InvalidBondOrLeverageAmount();
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
    IERC20(params.reserveToken).approve(address(factory), reserveAmount);
@>  pool = factory.createPool(params, reserveAmount, bondAmount, leverageAmount, bondName, bondSymbol, leverageName, leverageSymbol, true);

    emit PoolCreated(pool);
    poolCreated = true;
  }
```
The main problem is here, there is only check whether `reserveAmount` is not 0. The signigicant fixed amount of `bondAmount` of Bond token and `leverageAmount` of leverage token is minted, regardless of the `reserveAmount`. In case where `reserveAmount` is quite small compared to `bondAmount`, `leverageAmount`, the pool could be insolvent and users who deposit to this pool will lose funds.

```solidity
  function createPool(
    PoolParams calldata params,
    uint256 reserveAmount,
    uint256 bondAmount,
    uint256 leverageAmount,
    string memory bondName,
    string memory bondSymbol,
    string memory leverageName,
    string memory leverageSymbol,
    bool pauseOnCreation
  ) external whenNotPaused() onlyRole(POOL_ROLE) returns (address) {

    if (reserveAmount == 0) {
      revert ZeroReserveAmount();
    }
    ...

    // Mint seed amounts
@>  bondToken.mint(msg.sender, bondAmount);
@>  lToken.mint(msg.sender, leverageAmount);

    ...
  }
```


## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path
1. The attacker can exploit pre-deposit mechanism
    - PreDeposit is created.
    - As soon as PreDeposit is created, the attacker deposits `reserveCap` amount of reserve tokens with large gas fee.
    - Since the cap is reached, this make DOS for users who pre deposit.
    - Just before the `depositEndTime`, the attacker withdraw reserve tokens remaining dust amount of reserve tokens to the pool.
    - Then invoke `createPool()`. While creating a pool, there is only check for `reserveAmount` should not be 0 and the fixed amount of bond token and leverage token is minted.
    - Since the `reserveAmount` is very small to significant amount of bond/leverage token minted, the pool can be insolvent.

2. The users don't nearly pre-deposit and `reserveAmount` is very small value.

## Impact
The pool can be insolvent and the users who deposit to this pool will lose funds.

## Mitigation
Implement validation for `reserveAmount` while creating pool and mint bond and leverage token based on this value.
