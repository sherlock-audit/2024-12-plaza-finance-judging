# Missing Chainlink Price Feeds for wstETH/USD and stETH/USD in BalancerOracleAdapter.sol

### Summary

The BalancerOracleAdapter.sol contract relies on Chainlink price feeds to calculate the prices of tokens used in a Balancer pool to determine the reserveToken. However, the Chainlink price feed aggregators for wstETH/USD and stETH/USD do not exist. When these tokens are included in the Balancer pool, calls to latestRoundData() will revert, as the price feeds are unavailable.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol#L109

In the latestRoundData() function, the contract attempts to fetch prices for each token in the pool via Chainlink price feeds:

For tokens like wstETH and stETH, the contract expects a price feed in the form of wstETH/USD or stETH/USD. However, Chainlink does not provide such price feeds. As a result, any attempt to calculate prices for these tokens will fail, causing the contract to revert.


```javascript
    function latestRoundData() external view returns (uint80, int256, uint256, uint256, uint80) {
        .
        .
        .
        for(uint8 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            oracleDecimals = getOracleDecimals(address(tokens[i]), USD);
@>          prices[i] = getOraclePrice(address(tokens[i]), USD).normalizeAmount(oracleDecimals, decimals);
        }
        .
        .
        .
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The Balancer pool contains wstETH or stETH as part of the tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

	The protocol or user queries the latestRoundData() function to fetch the price of tokens in the pool.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

	If wstETH or stETH tokens are part of the Balancer pool, the latestRoundData() function will always revert.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
