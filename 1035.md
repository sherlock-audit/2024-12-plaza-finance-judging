# Pool.sol::distribute() Can Be Called During an Ongoing Auction

### Summary

The Pool.sol::distribute() function does not check whether an auction is ongoing or successful, allowing the distribute() function to be called during an active auction. This opens up the possibility of calling the distribution function prematurely, which can lead to the loss of coupon tokens.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L597

```javascript
    function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
        .
        .
        .
@>        if (
            Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT
                || Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD
        ) {
            emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
            return;
        }
```

In the current implementation, there is no check for whether an auction is still ongoing. The distribute() function checks the state of the previous auction (previousPeriod) but doesnâ€™t account for whether the current auction is in progress. This allows the function to be called even during an ongoing auction, which is a logical error.

### Internal Pre-conditions

	1.	An auction is active or ongoing.
	2.	The distribute() function is called.

### External Pre-conditions

	1.	The auction fails or is completed.
	2.	The distribution is triggered manually or by any external actor.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

	1.	Security Vulnerability: If the protocol holds coupon tokens, users could potentially steal those tokens by calling distribute() during an ongoing auction.
	2.	Protocol Abuse: Unauthorized or premature distribution of tokens could lead to a loss of funds or unfair allocation to users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, add a check to ensure that the auction has concluded (or failed) before calling the distribute() function. The modifier can be enhanced to revert if the auction is still ongoing.
