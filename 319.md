# New `BondAuction` Holders are Inappropriately Eligible for Full Period Distributions

## Finding description
When users acquire `BondTokens`, the contract updates their shares through the `updateIndexedUserAssets` function, which internally calls `getIndexedUserAmount` to calculate the user's shares. However, a critical issue arises from the fact that a user's `lastUpdatedPeriod` is initialized to 0 by default, while the period parameter corresponds to the current period (`globalPool.currentPeriod`). This setup causes the function to iterate through all periods from 0 to the current period, effectively crediting the user with shares for all prior periodsâ€”even if they had no participation during those times. This results in an over-allocation of shares, unfairly rewarding new participants for periods they did not contribute to.

## Proof of Concept
Lets say for an Example, as `BondToken` Holder sends their tokens to their secondary Account that has never participated, This is what would happen inside the `BondToken.sol`

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154C1-L164C4
```solidity
  function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused() {
    if (from != address(0)) {
      updateIndexedUserAssets(from, balanceOf(from));
    }

    if (to != address(0)) {
      updateIndexedUserAssets(to, balanceOf(to));
    }

    super._update(from, to, amount);
  }
```

As you can see that `_update` calls `updateIndexedUserAssets`, This is what `updateIndexedUserAssets` does

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L172C1-L181C1
```solidity
  function updateIndexedUserAssets(address user, uint256 balance) internal {
    uint256 period = globalPool.currentPeriod;
    uint256 shares = getIndexedUserAmount(user, balance, period);
    
    userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares = shares;
    userAssets[user].lastUpdatedPeriod = period;

    emit UpdatedUserAssets(user, period, shares);
  }

```

The `updateIndexedUserAssets` calls `getIndexedUserAmount` before it could update any state.

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L190C1-L199C4
```solidity
  function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
        shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
}
```

As you can see that `getIndexedUserAmount` will iterate through periods and keep in mind that this new address's `userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod` == 0

By the time it finishes iterating through periods, The returned shares will be added to `userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares`, which are used when distributing in `Distributor.sol`

## Impact
This vulnerability enables malicious users to game the system by cycling the same `BondTokens` through new accounts (or redeeming them) repeatedly, allowing them to accumulate disproportionately large portions of the distribution pool. This exploit undermines the fair allocation of rewards and depletes the pool, leaving legitimate long-term participants with little or no share of the distribution

## Recommended mitigation steps
Introduce a mechanism to track and validate the periods for new addresses receiving `BondTokens`. Specifically, ensure that when a user's `lastUpdatedPeriod` is initialized, it aligns with the current period of the `globalPool`. This prevents share accumulation for periods in which the user did not participate.
