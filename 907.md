# The "totalBuyCouponAmount" for an new Auction can be manuplated by a malicious actor

### Summary

Allowing anyone to call startAuction() in Pool.sol and calculating couponAmountToDistribute based on the total supply of bond tokens will cause significant manipulation of coupon distribution amount in the Auction.sol as an attacker will mint or redeem a large number of bond tokens using the create() and redeem() functions to inflate or deflate couponAmountToDistribute, call startAuction(), and exploit the totalBuyCouponAmount in Auction.sol. While fees are applied, the attacker can still significantly impact the coupon distribution(Depending on the Pool size).


### Root Cause

In [Pool.sol:530](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530), anyone has the ability to call the startAuction() function. Within the same function, the couponAmountToDistribute( [Pool.sol:549](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L549)) is calculated based on the total supply of bond tokens and sharesPerToken. This value is then assigned to the state variable totalBuyCouponAmount([Auction.sol:106](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L106)) in the newly deployed Auction.sol contract. Since totalBuyCouponAmount cannot be modified, an attacker could manipulate the bond token supply, potentially using a flash loan, to alter the totalBuyCouponAmount in the new Auction.sol smart contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

1. The block.timestamp value should be greater than lastDistribution + distributionPeriod.
2. The block.timestamp value should be less than lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod. 

### Attack Path

1. The Attacker waits for the block.timestamp to satisfy the conditions 
2. The Attacker either calls create() function [(Pool.sol:192)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L192) or redeem() function [(Pool.sol:353)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L353) with large quantity of depositAmount thereby altering the Bond token supply
3. Then calls the startAuction() function [(Pool.sol:530)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530) to deploy the Auction.sol contract with the manipulated "totalBuyCouponAmount " value
4. Then calls the create() function [(Pool.sol:192)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L192) or redeem() function [(Pool.sol:353)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L353) to get back the original assets minus fees.

### Impact

There are several potential effects of this Attack:

1. If the totalBuyCouponAmount in the Auction contract is large, the corresponding totalSellReserveAmount will also be large, which means the poolSaleLimit will be crossed and when the endauction() function is called the Auction will fail with "FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT" ([(Auction.sol:342)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L342)) state since there won't be enough reserve token in the pool contract, thereby resulting in the auction failure.

2. In the Auction contract, if the totalBuyCouponAmount is very large, the currentCouponAmount will always be less than the totalBuyCouponAmount, causing the auction to fail ([(Auction.sol:339)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L339)) when the "endAuction" function is called.

3. If the totalBuyCouponAmount in Auction.sol is very low, there will not be enough coupons to distribute to all the bond token holders.

4. If the totalBuyCouponAmount is larger, the amount of reserve tokens sold from Pool.sol will be large, affecting the collateral level calculation. The collateral level will be decreased, the Attacker can mint the Bond token for a discounted prize at the end of the Auction.

5. If the totalBuyCouponAmount is large, it affects the slot size([(Auction.sol:382)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L382)). If the slot size is very large, it will prevent certain participants from joining the auction due to the larger minimum coupons needed to participate.
 
6. If the totalBuyCouponAmount is larger, it benefits the leverage token holder as the extra coupon tokens will be available to them, providing them with more coupon tokens for their leverage tokens.
