# Missing __UUPSUpgradeable_init() in initialize functions

### Summary

A call to all `__X_init()` functions of all inherited contracts is necessary when dealing with UUPS upgradeability, however 2 contracts do not call the init function of `UUPSUpgradeable` which can lead to issues. The 2 contracts are `BondOracleAdapter` and `BalancerOracleAdapter`. There is a state variable in the `UUPSUpgradeable` contract namely `address private immutable __self` which gets set to `address(this)`. This `__self` variable gets used in the `onlyProxy` modifier of UUPS meaning that calls to functions like `upgradeTo` which use that modifier will fail. This can break the upgradeability of the 2 contracts.

### Root Cause

These are the 2 init functions which do not call `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()`.

### Mitigation

Call `__UUPSUpgradeable_init()` in the initialize functions of `BondOracleAdapter` and `BalancerOracleAdapter` in order to avoid this potential issue. Note that other `__X_init()` (like `__AccessControl_init`) functions are omited as well but they do not have a state variable in them so omiting them is fine.
