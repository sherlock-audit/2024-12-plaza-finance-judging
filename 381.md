# redeemRate Division Before Multiplication

### Summary

`getRedeemAmount` calculates the amount of reserve tokens to be redeemed for a given amount of bond or leverage tokens.

However, part of its implementation performs division before multiplication, which significantly rounds down the `redeemRate`, causing users to receive fewer tokens than expected.

### Root Cause

* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L514

```solidity
else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
    }
```

The `redeemRate` is negatively affected by this rounding, which results in an incorrect `redeemAmount`.

It is worth noting that `tvl`, `bondSupply`, and `assetSupply` have **18 decimals of precision**, while `BOND_TARGET_PRICE` is 0. As a result, during `((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply)`, all precision is lost, significantly affecting the final result.
