# Cannot get accumulated protocol fees.

### Summary

`claimFees` is only invoked when setting the `fee` and get protocol fee which is not accumulated.

### Root Cause

The protocol fee is calculated in the `claimFees` function of `Pool.sol` as follows.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L718-720
```solidity
  function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }
```

If balance of reserve token is zero at the moment the `fee` is set, the calculated protocol fee will be zero, and `lastFeeClaimTime` will be updated to `block.timestamp`.
This represents a logic error.


### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Get wrong protocol fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol should accumulate fees whenever the balance of the reserve token changes and update `lastFeeClaimTime` to `block.timestamp`. This would ensure that fees are correctly calculated and accumulated over time.
