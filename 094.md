# Precision loss in calculation of `redeemRate` in `Pool.sol::getRedeemAmount` function.

### Summary
In `getRedeemAmount` function the redeemRate at one instance is calculated as -

`redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;`

It's clearly divison before multiplication. which is classic case of precision error.

1. If numerator is less than denominator, then the result will be always zero.
2. and if redeemRate 0, due to above calculation the redeemAMount is also 0. due to following calculation.

`return ((depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) / ethPrice) / PRECISION;`

### Root Cause
Divison before multiplication

### Impact
Incorrect calculation of `redeemRate` and `redeemAmount`, hence user will not able to get correct amount of wstETH, that's intended.

### Mitigation

Using this instead -
`redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / assetSupply;`
