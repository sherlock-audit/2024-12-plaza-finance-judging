# missing access control  lead to lose of funds

### Summary

The **distribute** function in the **Pool** contract lacks **access contro**l, which means that anyone can call the function multiple times. This could result in transferring the **couponToken** twice for both the **previous and current periods**, leading to potential loss of funds by allocating more funds to users from the previous period .

### Root Cause

in pool.sol line 569 there is no access control which means that anyone can call it to transfer the  more funds that intended to the Distributor so that the      previous users can get more profit that intended
