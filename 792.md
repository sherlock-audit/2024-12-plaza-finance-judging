# Fee logic is flawed

### Summary

The fee logic is incorrect, and will lead to different fee amounts depending on when fees are claimed.

### Root Cause

The [fee to apply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/ab5bbd7d54042e4444b711a32def5b639fbd63b4/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L272) to the current pool reserves is computed based on the total elapsed time since the last claim, recorded by `lastFeeClaimTime`:

```solidity
// File: Pool.sol

function simulateCreate(
        TokenType tokenType,
        uint256 depositAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        ...

        // Calculate and subtract fees from poolReserves
        poolReserves =
            poolReserves -
            (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) /
            (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR); 
            
			...
	}
```

Whenever fees are claimed, `lastFeeClaimTime` is reset to the current timestamp:

```solidity
// File: Pool.sol

function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
        ...

        lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);

        emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
    }
```

This allows the fees to be gamed, given that claiming periods will dictate how big is the fee to apply to the current reserve balances.

### Attack Path

Consider the following two scenarios, both starting initially with `lastFeeClaimTime` = 0, `poolReserves` = 500, a current `block.timestamp` = 262800 (1 month) and a 20% fee.

- User 1 flow:
    1. At the initial state, the fee is given by 20% * 500 * (262800 - 0) / 31536000, so the fee **≈** 0.84 tokens.
    2. User 1 deposits 100 tokens into the pool. The fee now becomes 20% * 600 * (262800 - 0) / 31536000 = 1 token.
    3. After six months pass, `block.timestamp` becomes 15768000. Without additional deposits/withdrawals, the fee  **≈** 20% * 600 * (15768000 - 0) / 31536000 **≈** 60 tokens**.**
- User 2 flow, restarting the process:
    1. At the initial state, fee **≈** 0.84 tokens, as mentioned in user 1 flow. However, the `feeBeneficiary` triggers `claimFees`, the fees are transferred to the beneficiary, and the pool’s balance becomes 500 - 0.84 tokens = 499.16 tokens. `lastFeeClaimTime` is also set to the current timestamp, 262800.
    2. After the claim, user 2 deposits 100 tokens into the pool. The balance of the pool becomes 599.16 tokens. The fee is 0, given that `block.timestamp` == `lastFeeClaimTime`, so the elapsed time is 0.
    3. A total of six months pass, and `block.timestamp` becomes 15768000. Without additional deposits/withdrawals, the fee  **≈** 20% ***** 599.16 * (15768000 - 262800) / 31536000 **≈** 58,9174**.**

The total fee in the same period of time, depending on when fee claiming is performed changes from a total of 60 tokens to a total of 58,9174 tokens.

### Impact

This issue has two main impacts:

- The fee beneficiary will obtain less fees, depending on when claiming is performed. Considering the examples described in the attack path, if the reserve token is WETH, and considering a price of $3000 per ETH, the amount of lost fees for the fee beneficiary is (60 - 58,9174) * 3000 = $3247,8. This can become much larger with more pool interactions, effectively causing a loss of funds without external limitations.
- The computed TVL in deposits and redemptions changes, depending on when claims are performed. This will affect the main mechanics in the protocol, which aim at computing how much bond tokens / leverage tokens should be minted/redeemed, depending on the current collateral ratio, which heavily relies on the pool’s total TVL.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply fees as a fixed percentage of deposited tokens, and track the total reserves in the pool virtually (with a storage variable), instead of using `IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
