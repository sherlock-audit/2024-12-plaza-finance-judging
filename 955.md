# `Auction::claimBid` ERC20 transfer missing return value check can cause loss for bidder

### Summary

The `claimBid` function performs an ERC20.transfer() call but does not check the success return value.
Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead, which means it can silently fail.

### Root Cause

If the reserve token is a non-ERC20 standard token, the ERC20.transfer() in the `claimBid` can silently fail and not be accounted for due to missing checks/reverts

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The reserve token transfer fails

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the transfer of the reserve token transfer fails, the bidder gets nothing in the end for their bid due to the `bidInfo.claimed` being set to true before the transfer fails

### Mitigation

I recommend using [OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/23869e5b2a7c6b9c3e27dee4289615b8cf50e36b/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L20) versions with the safeTransfer function that handles the return value check as well for non-standard-compliant tokens.
