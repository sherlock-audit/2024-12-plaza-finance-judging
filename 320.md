# The `BondToken` contract does not differentiate between old vs new balance that stayed for a period

## Finding description
When calculating a `BondToken` holder's shares for distributions, the contract does not differentiate between the user's old balance (which may have been held for an extended period) and newly deposited tokens. Instead, it uses the user's entire balance (new + old) for the calculation.

For example, consider a scenario where a user claims their distribution at `Period 1` and then withdraws their `BondTokens`, leaving just 1 wei behind. After 2 periods pass, the user redeposits 1e18 tokens at `Period 4`. Because the contract calculates shares based on the total balance (old + new), the newly deposited 1e18 tokens will now be treated as if they have been held for the full duration of the 1 wei that remained in the contract for those 2 periods.

## Proof of Concept

This is how the shares are calculated `balance` always being the total Amount the user is currently owning

```solidity
    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
@>     shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }
```

## Impact
Users can leave out 1 wei worth `BondTokens` and when they are planning to collect distributions they can mint new `BondTokens` to get more shares with the help of this 1 wei (Period).

## Recommended mitigation steps
Implement a mechanism to differentiate between newly deposited tokens and existing ones, tracking the duration that each portion of the user's balance has been held separately.
