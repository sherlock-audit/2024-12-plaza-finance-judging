# Protocol loses portion of accumulated fees after each Auction

### Summary

`getFeeAmount` calculates the fee amount based on total `reserveToken` balance. `endAuction` reduces the balance without claiming fees first.

### Root Cause

`claimFees` intended to `claim the accumulated protocol fees`. Keyword is **accumulated**.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L700
```solidity
/**
 * @dev Allows the fee beneficiary to claim the accumulated protocol fees.
 */
function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
  require(msg.sender == feeBeneficiary || poolFactory.hasRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE(), msg.sender), NotBeneficiary());
  uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();
  
  if (feeAmount == 0) {
    revert NoFeesToClaim();
  }
  
  lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
  IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
  
  emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
}

/**
 * @dev Returns the amount of fees to be claimed.
 * @return The amount of fees to be claimed.
 */
function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
  return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336
```solidity
function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
  if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

  if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
    state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
  } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
      state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
  } else {
    state = State.SUCCEEDED;
    Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
  }

  emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
}
```

For example the test suite checks that after 365 days the expected fee amount is successfully claimed.

`endAuction` calls `transferReserveToAuction` without clearing any accumulated fees first.

Since distribution/auctions happen every 90 days, and default configuration `poolSaleLimit` is 95. Protocol may lose up to 95% of its owned accumulated fees after and during the auction.

Note that other operations that affect balance (redeem/create) do take fees into consideration.

This issue matches with Sherlock rule: admin is not aware of the consequences of his (non) action.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A successful auction reduces the balance of reserveToken.
2. Any unclaimed accumulated fees will be impacted.

### Impact

Loss of fees for the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Call `claimFees` at `endAuction`.
