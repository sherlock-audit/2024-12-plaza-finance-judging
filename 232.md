# Every auction can be DoS'ed.

## Bug description
Each auction has a `poolSaleLimit` variable that determines the maximum amount of reserves that can be sold in the auction. This is enforced in the `endAuction` function, which will mark the auction as failed if the amount sold is greater than the limit.

[Auction.sol#L341-L342](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341-L342)
```solidity
} else if (
    totalSellReserveAmount >=
    (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100
) {
    state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
```

However, this opens up a DoS attack vector, which allows malicious users to DoS every auction. A user could push a lot of bids with `buyReserveAmount` set to `MAX_BID_AMOUNT` and specify a big price, so his bids are not considered out of range, so the total amount of reserves bought will be greater than the sale limit. Subsequently this auction will fail due to the discussed check and a user will be able to safely refund all of his bids.

## Root cause
Enforcing `poolSaleLimit` check in `endAuction` function instead of `bid` function.

## Attack path
1. User creates a lot of bids with `buyReserveAmount` set to `MAX_BID_AMOUNT` and high price so his bids are not out of range.
2. By doing so he pushes the `totalSellReserveAmount` to a value greater than what's allowed by poolSaleLimit.
3. Because of that when `endAuction` is called, the auction is considered to be failed.
4. User refunds all of his bids.

## Impact
DoS of every auction.

## Recommended Mitigation
Instead of enforcing this check in the `endAuction()` function, check the sale limit during bidding and revert if the bid goes past that sale limit.
