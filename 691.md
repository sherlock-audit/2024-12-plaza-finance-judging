# Reentrancy vulnerability in redeemTokens()

### Summary

A missing reentrancy guard in the `redeemTokens()` function of `Pool.sol` will allow attackers to drain funds repeatedly in a single transaction, severely impacting all token holders.

### Root Cause

In `Pool.sol:245`, there is a missing `nonReentrant` modifier on the `redeemTokens()` function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must have a balance of tokens to redeem.
2. `redeemTokens()` needs to be callable by the token holder without restrictions during the redemption phase.

### External Pre-conditions

External calls to untrusted contracts  must occur within the `redeemTokens()` function, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `redeemTokens()` with a valid token balance.

2. During the execution, the ERC20 `transfer()` function calls back into `Pool.sol` exploiting the lack of a reentrancy guard.

3. The attacker re-enters `redeemTokens()` multiple times in a single transaction, draining the pool's funds or their own balance repeatedly.

### Impact

The token holders suffer a complete loss of their staked assets due to the unauthorized multiple redemptions. The attacker can drain the funds available in the contract up to the amount they can reenter.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ReentrancyGuard` in the `redeemTokens()` function to prevent reentry.
