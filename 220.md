# Denial of Service via Donation Attack in `PreDeposit.sol`

### Summary

The `PreDeposit.sol` contains functionality for managing deposits within a specified time window, governed by a reserve cap. An attacker can exploit the withdrawal mechanism during the deposit phase to orchestrate a "Donation Attack" resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). By temporarily occupying the full reserve cap and withdrawing assets near the deposit periodâ€™s end, the attacker can prevent legitimate users from participating.

### Root Cause

Users can pre deposit by calling any of these functions: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L110-L116

```Solidity
  function deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _deposit(amount, onBehalfOf);
  }

  function deposit(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    _deposit(amount, address(0));
  }
``` 
Both these functions call this function:  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L118-L134

```Solidity
  function _deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) private checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
    if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached();

    address recipient = onBehalfOf == address(0) ? msg.sender : onBehalfOf;

    // if user would like to put more than available in cap, fill the rest up to cap and add that to reserves
    if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
      amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
    }

    balances[recipient] += amount;
    reserveAmount += amount;

    IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    emit Deposited(recipient, amount);
  }
```
And if users want to withdraw their assets, they can call this function before `DepositEndTime`:   https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L136-L144

```Solidity
  function withdraw(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    reserveAmount -= amount;

    IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);

    emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
  }

```
The vulnerability arises due to unrestricted withdrawals during the deposit phase, coupled with a lack of per-user deposit limits. Attackers can exploit this by filling the reserve cap and withdrawing just before the end of the deposit period, leaving insufficient time for other users to make deposits.

There is another function : 

```Solidity
  function setDepositEndTime(uint256 newDepositEndTime) external onlyOwner checkDepositNotEnded {
    if (newDepositEndTime <= depositEndTime) revert DepositEndMustOnlyBeExtended();
    if (newDepositEndTime <= depositStartTime) revert DepositEndMustBeAfterStart();
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
    
    depositEndTime = newDepositEndTime;
  }
```
The owner can call this to extend the deposit period but still, the attacker can perform the same attack vector. The core issue with the unbounded deposits and withdrawals still persists.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Deposit Phase:

* Immediately after the deposit period begins (block.timestamp >= depositStartTime), Alice calls the `deposit()` function with an amount equal to or exceeding `reserveCap`.
* Since the `deposit()` logic caps any excess above `reserveCap`, Alice successfully fills the entire reserve capacity in a single transaction.
* As a result:
  * `reserveAmount` becomes equal to `reserveCap`.
  * Subsequent deposit attempts by genuine users fail, reverting with the `DepositCapReached` error.

Withdrawal Phase:

* Just before the `depositEndTime`, Alice invokes the `withdraw()` function and withdraws all her previously deposited tokens.
* By this time, the deposit period is effectively over for genuine users, who had no opportunity to deposit their tokens due to the capacity being fully utilized by Alice's deposits.


### Impact

* Legitimate users cannot participate in the pre-deposit process due to the reserve capacity being fully exploited by Alice.
* The contract faces a denial-of-service (DOS) scenario, effectively halting the intended purpose of pre-deposits.
* Even though Alice withdraws her tokens later, the protocol cannot recover the lost opportunity for user participation.

### PoC

Steps to Reproduce:

Initial Deposit by the Attacker:

* Set `reserveCap` = 100 ether.

* Attacker deposits 100 ether, fully occupying the reserve.

Denial of Service:

* Other users attempting to call `deposit` during this time will revert with `DepositCapReached`.

Withdraw Just Before Deposit End Time:

* Attacker calls the `withdraw` function, withdrawing their 100 ether right before `depositEndTime`.

Impact on Other Users:

* By the time other users can deposit, the deposit period has ended (`checkDepositNotEnded` modifier reverts their calls), resulting in a DoS attack.

### Mitigation

Implement Lock Period for Withdrawals:

Disallow withdrawals during the deposit phase.

Example: 

```Solidity
modifier checkWithdrawalAllowed() {
    if (block.timestamp >= depositStartTime && block.timestamp <= depositEndTime) {
        revert WithdrawalNotAllowedDuringDeposit();
    }
    _;
}

function withdraw(uint256 amount) external checkWithdrawalAllowed {
    // Withdrawal logic
}
```
