# Malicious Actor will distrupt Auction Mechanism for protocol users

### Summary

In the `startAuction` function, the dynamic deployment of the `Auction` contract without proper error handling will cause a denial of service (DOS) for protocol users as a malicious actor will exploit the vulnerability by forcing the deployment to revert.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530
In the code snippet, the dynamic deployment of the `Auction` contract using `Utils.deploy` is vulnerable to failures, such as insufficient gas or errors in the `Auction` contracts initialization.

The auction initialization process calculates critical parameters like couponAmountToDistribute based on current state variables without protection against manipulation.

The initialization function `startAuction()` lacks mechanisms to prevent transaction ordering attacks, making it susceptible to front-running.

The auction deployment process occurs in a single transaction without any time delays or commitment phases, allowing attackers to predict and exploit the exact initialization conditions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


The malicious actor will monitor the mempool for the transaction calling `startAuction` and submit a high-gas transaction that causes the `Auction` contract deployment to fail (depoying a malicious contracts that reverts during initialization) This will prevent the auction from starting, disrupting the protocol functionality.


### Impact
1. Delayed execution of the start auctions:  preventing auctions from starting and disrupting the protocol's functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling using` try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle deployment failures to prevent a complete DOS
