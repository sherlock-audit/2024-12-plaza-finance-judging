# Incorrect period used to access an auction.

## Bug description
When `endAuction()` is called and the auction has succeeded, the function attempts to transfer reserves from the pool via calling `pool::transferReserveToAuction()` function. This function attempts to access that auction by using `currentPeriod` variable, which is incorrect.

[Pool.sol#L578-L580](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L578-L580)
```solidity
(uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
```

If we look at the `startAuction()` function, we would see that an auction is stored at the `currentPeriod` index right before the variable is incremented in `bondToken::increaseIndexedAssetPeriod()`.

[Pool.sol#L552-L567](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L552-L567)
```solidity
auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
    address(new Auction()),
    abi.encodeWithSelector(
        Auction.initialize.selector,
        address(couponToken),
        address(reserveToken),
        couponAmountToDistribute,
        block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
        1000,
        address(this),
        poolSaleLimit
    )
);
// Increase the bond token period
// @audit-info store the current period as previous period and increment current period
bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);
```

That means to access an ended auction, we would need to query it using `currentPeriod - 1`. This is also supported by the fact that `distribute()` function does exactly that when trying to get the amount of coupons distributed in a completed auction.

[Pool.sol#L594-L595](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L594-L595)
```solidity
// Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod])
    .totalBuyCouponAmount();
```

And since `transferReserveToAuction` checks if the `msg.sender` is the auction for the `currentPeriod` it will always revert.

The same problem exists in the `NotInAuction` modifier.

[Pool.sol#L750-L754](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L750-L754)
```solidity
modifier NotInAuction() {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0), AuctionIsOngoing());
    _;
}
```

No auction exists for the `currentPeriod`, as the period is incremented right after the auction start, therefore this modifier will always pass, as address of the auction at current period is always 0.

## Root cause
Incorrect period used to access a completed auction.

## Attack path
No attack path.

## Impact
DoS of the `endAuction()` function and incorrect check in `NotInAuction` modifier.
## Recommended Mitigation
Access the auction using `currentPeriod - 1`.
