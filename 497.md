# Unable to Remove Bid Due to USDC Blacklist

### Summary

In [`Auction.sol:_removeBid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L298), the contract directly calls `IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount)` to refund the `buyCouponToken` to the bidder being removed. If the bidder’s address is blacklisted by the token contract (e.g., USDC), the transfer will revert, preventing the `_removeBid` function from completing. As a result, the bid function DOS and becomes stuck and cannot progress.


### Root Cause


When a user enters a bid, the transfer of `buyCouponToken` = USDC is transfer from user to the auction to buy reserve tokens. The logic here is that if a `highestBidIndex` is coming, it removes the `lowestBidIndex` by calling the `_removeBid` internal function.

```solidity
  function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns(uint256) {
    
    //....
    
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sellCouponAmount);

    //....
    if (bidCount > maxBids) {
      if (lowestBidIndex == newBidIndex) {
        revert BidAmountTooLow();
      }
      _removeBid(lowestBidIndex);
    }

    // Remove and refund out of range bids
    removeExcessBids();

    //...
```


In the `_removeBid` function, it first sends USDC to the bidder with the `lowestBidIndex` and then deletes that bid.

```solidity
  function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
    //...


    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);

    emit BidRemoved(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);

    delete bids[bidIndex];
    bidCount--;
  }
```

So, the problem here is that if a malicious `bidder` places the lowest bid and then acts maliciously, the USDC contract blacklists that bidder's address. Based on this action, the bidder could perform a DoS attack on the entire bidding function, causing the auction to never be processed. This happens because the bidder with the lowest bid gets blacklisted by the USDC contract, and the `removeBid` function will always revert.



### Internal Pre-conditions




### External Pre-conditions

The malicious bidder’s address must be blacklisted in the `buyCouponToken(USDC)` contract.


### Attack Path

1. **Malicious Bidder Enters the Auction:**
   The attacker places a bid with the lowest bid amount, becoming the bidder with the `lowestBidIndex` in the auction.

2. **Malicious Behavior:**
   The bidder then acts maliciously, causing their address to be blacklisted by the `buyCouponToken` (e.g., USDC) contract.

3. **Triggering the `_removeBid` Function:**
   Due to the auction logic, if the bid count exceeds a certain limit (`maxBids`), or the `out of range bids` the contract will attempt to remove the lowest bid by calling the `_removeBid` or `removeExcessBids()` internal function.

4. **Attempt to Refund the Bidder:**
   Inside the `_removeBid` function or `removeExcessBids()` function, the contract tries to refund the malicious bidder (the one with the `lowestBidIndex`) by transferring the `buyCouponToken` (e.g., USDC) back to them.

5. **Blacklist Causes Transfer Revert:**
   Since the malicious bidder’s address is blacklisted by the USDC contract, the transfer of `buyCouponToken` fails and reverts. The revert is caused by the blacklist preventing the successful token transfer.

6. **Denial of Service (DoS):**
   Due to the revert, the `_removeBid` function or `removeExcessBids()` function fails to complete. This causes the bidding function to become stuck, as the auction contract cannot successfully remove the lowest bid. The bid process cannot continue, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) for the auction.

7. **Auction Stalls and Cannot Proceed:**
   The auction is effectively stalled because the lowest bid cannot be removed, and new bids cannot be processed until the issue is resolved. This results in the auction being blocked indefinitely, effectively preventing any further bidding activity.


### Impact

Complete Denial of Service (DoS) of the bid function for that auction. The auction cannot process further bids, as the malicious bidder’s address being blacklisted causes the _removeBid function to fail every time, effectively stalling the auction indefinitely.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of pushing the the buy tokens amount to bidders, let them claim it (Pull over push pattern).
