# A missing check in `Auction.sol:bid` allows an attacker to win the auction without placing a higher bid

### Summary

The lack of a proper check in the `Auction.sol::bid` allows malicious actors to exploit the bidding system. By placing multiple identical bids from different accounts, the attackers can cause the oldest bid to be excluded, winning the auction without increasing the highest bid. This flaw allows attackers to bypass fair competition, granting them an unfair advantage and undermines trust in the platform.

### Root Cause

In `Auction.sol::bid`, the contract allows identical bids to be places and fails to properly handle the exclusion of the oldest bid when the maximum bid count is reached. This oversight allows malicious actors to call the `bid()` in `Action.sol:125` to place multiple identical bids, which results in the oldest bid being excluded, once the `maxBid` count is reached. This allows the attackers to win the auction without exceeding the current highest bid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.The attacker/attackers must know the exact value `maxBid` is set to. (for the purpose of my test this value was set to 3 for simplicity)
2.The attackers (or one attacker using different addresses) needs to place multiple bids with the exact same value as the highest bid yet, to trigger the exclusion mechanism.


### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The Auction starts and a `maxBid` value is set.
2. The attackers knowing this value can either execute the attack in the middle of the auction or can prepare and set up their plan and patiently wait, so they can execute it in the last minute before the auction finishes, making the attack even more unexpected.
3. Lets say the `maxBid` is set to 3, so if a fourth bid is attempted to be included it first checks if it is the lowest of them all and if that's the case then the bid is rejected, otherwise it is included into the array but the lowest bid is excluded from it. The attacker prepares 3 different accounts (or 3 attackers can execute it separately with one account each), calling the `Auction.sol::bid` with the exact same value as the current highest bid. Since there isn't any check or a require statement that prevents bids with equal values to be placed and the bids are stored in an array in descending order, the first 2 of the 3 bids the attacker places are included into the array of bids next to the initial higher bid (all share the same value). Once the attacker's third bid gets placed, instead of it being rejected, the oldest bid in the array is excluded leaving the array containing only the three bids the attacker placed. This is especially dangerous if being executed seconds before the auction ends, which basically guarantees the attacker the win, without having to bid higher than the current higher bid. The other 2 bids the attacker placed are refunded after the auction is finished.

### Impact

In this scenario, the attacker/s can win the auction without placing a higher bid than the other participants. They only need to place the same quantity of bids as the `maxBid` vlaue (if the `maxBid` is set to 3 the attacker must place 3 separate bids from 3 different accounts), all bids the attacker places must be equal as the current max bid. Using this strategy the attacker gains an unfair advantage. After the auction is finished the attacker wins and can call the refund function to refund the tokens they used to bid with the other accounts.


### PoC

I used the already available `Auction.t.sol` for my test, adding it at the bottom and executing only it. It proves that if the `maxBid` array is exceeded with bids with equal values, the oldest bid is being excluded.

```solidity
function testOldestBidExclusionWhenMaxBidExceeded() public {
    uint256 bidAmount = 1000; // Same value for each bid
    uint256 sellAmount = 1000000000; 
    uint256 maxBids = 3; // Set max bids to 3 for the test
    
    // Place initial bids (maxBids - 1)
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < maxBids - 1; i++) {
        address newBidder = address(uint160(i + 1)); // Unique bidder address
        vm.startPrank(newBidder);
        usdc.mint(newBidder, sellAmount);
        usdc.approve(address(auction), sellAmount);
        auction.bid(bidAmount, sellAmount); // Place the bid
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    // Now place the final bid that should cause the 4th bid to be placed
    address finalBidder = address(uint160(maxBids)); // Address for the final bid
    uint256 finalBidAmount = bidAmount; // Keep the bid amount the same
    uint256 finalSellAmount = 1000000000;

    // Start placing the final bid
    vm.startPrank(finalBidder);
    usdc.mint(finalBidder, finalSellAmount);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), finalSellAmount);
    
    // Expect the oldest bid (Bid 1) to be excluded after the 4th bid
    auction.bid(finalBidAmount, finalSellAmount); // This should succeed
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Now check the bids in the contract after the 4th bid
    uint256 bidCountAfter = auction.bidCount();
    assertEq(bidCountAfter, maxBids, "Bid count should be 3 after excluding the oldest bid.");
    
    // Ensure that the oldest bid (Bid 1) is excluded, and the others are retained
    uint256 lowestBidIndex = auction.lowestBidIndex();
    (, uint256 lowestBidAmount,,,,) = auction.bids(lowestBidIndex);
    assertEq(lowestBidAmount, bidAmount, "The oldest bid should have been excluded.");
}
```

### Mitigation

Add a check in the `Auction::bid`  before a bid is being placed to make sure that an identical bid doesn't already exist.

Here are two solutions I came up:
1. Add a for loop, looping from existing bids in the bid array, making sure the bid the user is trying to place is not identical as an existing one. This may not be gas efficient if the existing bids are a large number.
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 1; i <= lastBidIndex; i++) {
    if (bids[i].buyReserveAmount == buyReserveAmount && bids[i].sellCouponAmount == sellCouponAmount) {
        revert IdenticalBidNotAllowed();
    }
}
```
2.Adds an if statement to make sure a bid with this combination of `buyReserveAmount` and `sellCouponAmount` has not been placed yet.
```solidity
if (bidCombinationExists[buyReserveAmount][sellCouponAmount]) {
        revert IdenticalBidNotAllowed();
    }
```
After the bid is placed we can set the value to true to ensure a duplicate bid wont be placed.
```solidity
bidCombinationExists[buyReserveAmount][sellCouponAmount] = true;
```
