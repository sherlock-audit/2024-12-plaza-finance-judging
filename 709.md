# Lack of coupon token to pay bond holders if auctions failed

### Summary

Business logic - The indexed assets variable (`globalPool`) in BondToken is updated whenever an auction starts (`startAuction()`), but the `distribute()` does not transfer coupon tokens to Distributor when the auction fails, which leads to lack of coupon token accounted for the increased indexed assets.

### Root Cause

The choice to increase the indexed assets variable at the start of an auction without a mechanism, such as re-auction (for failed auctions) or similar, to compensate for the increased indexed assets is the cause of this bug. 

In [Pool.sol:567](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L567),
```solidity
function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
    ...
    auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
      address(new Auction()),...
    );

    // Increase the bond token period
    bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);
  }
``` 
The `increaseIndexedAssetPeriod()` function in BondToken will record an increase in coupon rewards for all users for the current distribution period.

But in [Pool.sol:597-602](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L597-L602), the `distribute()` function do nothing in both two cases where the auction failed.
```solidity
function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    ...
    if (Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT ||
        Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD) {

      emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
      return;
    }
    ...
}
```

### Impact

While users can still claim their coupon tokens in case of failed auctions, if other users have not claimed their shares, everyone cannot claim their shares. This can be considered a loss in yield for bond token holders, and the amount or proportion of lost assets depends on the number of failed auctions and the `sharesPerToken` value of each period. 

The impact might be severe because no mechanism is specified/documented to fulfill the lacking token, which means no one is accountable for this loss.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Implementing/Documenting a mechanism to fulfill the lack of coupon tokens to pay bond holders if there are failed auctions, e.g. re-auction, direct transfer of coupon tokens to Distributor, etc.
