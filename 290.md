# Precision Loss in Constant Definitions

### Summary

The contract uses fixed-point arithmetic with constants that could lead to precision loss in calculations.

### Root Cause

In 'pool.sol:33-35' The constants use a precision of 1M (PRECISION = 1000000) which might be insufficient for some financial calculations.    https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol?plain=1#L33-35

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Operations involving these constants
2. Multiple mathematical operations in sequence

### External Pre-conditions

1. Large numbers in calculations
2. Complex mathematical operations

### Attack Path

1. Input large numbers that when multiplied with these constants
2. Cause rounding errors due to precision limitations
3. Accumulate errors across multiple operations

### Impact

1. Potential loss of precision in financial calculations
2. Rounding errors affecting user balances
3. Possible manipulation of ratios and thresholds

### PoC

// Example of potential precision loss
uint256 largeAmount = type(uint256).max / 1e15;
uint256 result = (largeAmount * POINT_EIGHT) / PRECISION;
// Could lead to unexpected rounding


### Mitigation

1. Increase precision to 1e18 (standard in DeFi):uint256 private constant PRECISION = 1e18;
uint256 private constant POINT_EIGHT = 8e17;
uint256 private constant POINT_TWO = 2e17;
uint256 private constant COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD = 12e17;
2. Add checks for precision loss in critical calculations
3. Consider using a fixed-point library for precise calculations
