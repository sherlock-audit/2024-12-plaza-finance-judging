# Improper Access Control in `BondToken.sol::resetIndexedUserAssets Function`.

According to the natspec given by the developers`@notice Can only be called by addresses with the GOV_ROLE and when the contract is not paused.`,The`resetIndexedUserAssets` function in the `BondToken.sol` contract is intended to be restricted to callers with the `GOV_ROLE` . However, the access control mistakenly allows only addresses with the `DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE` to execute the function.

## mitigation 
```diff
+function increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(uint256 sharesPerToken) public onlyRole(GOV_ROLE) whenNotPaused {}

```
