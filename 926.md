# Unspent deposit amount is stuck in `BalancerRouter` and not returned to depositor

## Summary

Unspend BalancerPoolToken reserve token is not refunded to user and can be stuck in `BalancerRouter`

## Vulnerability Details

In the event that a user pre deposits a BalancerPoolToken (BPT) `reserveToken` via `BalancerRouter.joinBalancerAndPredeposit`, the unspend BPT tokens will not be returned to the user and will be stuck in the `BalancerRouter`

In `BalancerRouter.joinBalancerAndPredeposit`, a user will supply an array of asset token and BPT tokens will be received by the `BalancerRouter`.

```solidity
    function joinBalancerAndPredeposit(
        bytes32 balancerPoolId,
        address _predeposit,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        // Step 1: Join Balancer Pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = joinBalancerPool(balancerPoolId, assets, maxAmountsIn, userData);

        // Step 2: Approve balancerPoolToken for PreDeposit
        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(_predeposit, balancerPoolTokenReceived);

        // Step 3: Deposit to PreDeposit
        PreDeposit(_predeposit).deposit(balancerPoolTokenReceived, msg.sender); // @audit full BPT token received might not be spend

        return balancerPoolTokenReceived;
    }
```

Subsequently the function calls the `PreDeposit.deposit` function. If the amount of BPT tokens supplied hits the cap, PreDeposit will take the difference of the `reserveAmount` and the amount of BPT token deposited by the user to fill up to the `reserveCap`. The difference will then be transferred to the PreDeposit contract.

However, the remanining amount of BPT tokens aill be stuck in `BalancerRouter` and remain unused.

```solidity

  function _deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) private checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
    if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached();

    address recipient = onBehalfOf == address(0) ? msg.sender : onBehalfOf;

    // if user would like to put more than available in cap, fill the rest up to cap and add that to reserves
    if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
      amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount; // @audit difference in amount is taken
    }

    balances[recipient] += amount;
    reserveAmount += amount;

    IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount); // @audit full BPT tokens received is not transferred to PreDeposit contract

    emit Deposited(recipient, amount);
  }
```

## POC

Consider the following scenario

1. Alice sends WETH and WBTC to receive 100 BPT tokens in return via `BalancerRouter.joinBalancerAndPredeposit`
2. Suppose in `PreDeposit`, `reserveAmount` = 100 BPT and `reserveCap` = 101 BPT.
3. Entering `PreDeposit.deposit -> PreDeposit._deposit` - the amount of BPT tokens that will be deposited by Alice will be 1 BPT
4. `BalancerRouter` will send 1 BPT to the `PreDeposit` contract.
5. The remaining 99 BPT tokens will remain in `BalancerRouter`.
6. Alice has no way to retrieve that unspend 99 BPT tokens.

## Impact

BPT reserve tokens will be stuck in the router. Loss of tokens for users.

## Mitigation

Refund the unspend BPT tokens to the user who predeposits via the `BalancerRouter`
