# Starting auction will take longer than it should have when the auction did not succeed

### Summary

The [stratAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530) can be DOS in case of auction not succeeding.

### Root Cause

If the auction ends in ` state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`, the auction should be restarted again, but because the `lastDistribution` was never updated, the auction will take longer than it should   to start again.

This can happen in the situations displayed below ðŸ‘‡

```solidity
Auction.sol


  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
        if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();
    
        if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
@>          state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
        } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
@>           state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
        } else {
          state = State.SUCCEEDED;
          Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
          IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
        }
    
        emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

Can happen in normal operation.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User or anyone starts the [auction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530) and the `lastDistribution  is updated to `block.timeStamp`
2.  The state of the auction now ends in either `state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` or  `state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD`
3. Now the auction should be started again
4. Now assuming  the `distributionPeriod` would be adjusted, the auction period (10 days to say) would be in the past and  this require statement will fail and revert.

```solidity
Pool.sol

// Check if auction period hasn't passed
    require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());
```
Updating the `auctionPeriod` like the `distributionPeriod` would mean an increase in the ending time of the auction which will ultimately affect the quarterly intended calculations.


### Impact

1. Starting auction will take longer than it should have.
2. The fixed coupons that should be distributed quarterly will not be distributed.

### Mitigation

This can be mitigated by modifying these [require](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L532C5-L536C1) statements to pass if  state == `state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT or state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD`.
