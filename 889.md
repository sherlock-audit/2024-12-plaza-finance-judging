# `LeverageToken` holders can drain the pool.

### Summary

If `collateralLevel < 120%`, then `20%` of TVL is allocated for `LeverageToken` holders. This mechanism is fundamentally flawed.

- In this case, if half of the total `LeverageToken`s is redeemed, `10%` of TVL is redeemed, reducing the TVL to `90%`.
- If half of the remaining `LeverageToken`s is redeemed again, `10%` of remaining TVL is redeemed again, decreasing the TVL further to `81%`.

As you can see, at each step, the TVL decreases to `90%` of its previous value. Therefore, after `n` steps, the TVL is reduced to `0.9^n` of the original TVL.

By repeatedly executing this process, `LeverageToken` holders can drain the pool.

### Root Cause

The [getRedeemAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L511-L512) function calculates the `redeemRate` based on whether the `collateralLevel` is above or below `120%`.

- If `collateralLevel <= 120%`:
  ```solidity
    redeemRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply
  ```
  Here, multiplier is `20%`, and `assetSupply` is the total supply of `LeverageToken`.
This indicates that when `collateralLevel <= 120%`, `20%` of TVL is allocated for `LeverageToken` holders.

Thus, the attack mentioned in the `Summary` section can drain the pool.

Additionally, in the case where `collateralLevel > 120%`, `LeverageToken` holders can reduce the `collateralLevel` down to `120%` by redeeming a significant portion of their `LeverageToken`s. Therefore, the attack remains possible.

```solidity
      function getRedeemAmount(
        ...
        
        uint256 redeemRate;
511     if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
          redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
        } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
          redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
        } else {
          redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
        }
        
        ...
      }
```
