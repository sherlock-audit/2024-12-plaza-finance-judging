# Incorrect market rate applies when redeeming levETH tokens

### Summary

When `Pool::redeem` is called it calls the internal [Pool::simulateRedeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L443-L451), the function gets both token supply and also gets the market rate for bond / liquidity token.

It then calls `getRedeemAmount`, which calculates the collateral ratio and also the redeem rate for both leverage and bond tokens.


```solidity
function getRedeemAmount(
        TokenType tokenType,
        uint256 depositAmount,
        uint256 bondSupply,
        uint256 levSupply,
        uint256 poolReserves,
        uint256 ethPrice,
        uint8 oracleDecimals,
        uint256 marketRate
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
         ....

        uint256 redeemRate;
        if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
            redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
        } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
            redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
        } else {
            redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
        }

        if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
            redeemRate = marketRate;
        }

        return ((depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) / ethPrice) / PRECISION;
    }
```

However, `marketRate` is the market rate of the bond token, but it also applies for leverage eth tokens, which might cause users to claim less.

### Root Cause

`Pool::simulateRedeem` only gets the market rate for bond tokens, even if the user is trying to claim levETH.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User will claim less levETH tokens than they are entitled to.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider getting the market rate for the token the user is trying to claim instead of only the bond token market rate
