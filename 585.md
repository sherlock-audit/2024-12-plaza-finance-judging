# Auction can fail if USDC blacklists user after bid placement

## Description & Impact
Consider the scenario:
1. Alice places her bid.
2. She gets added into the USDC blacklist.
3. Bob places a higher bid. The `bid()` function either [internally calls `_removeBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L157) or internally [calls `removeExcessBids()` which in turn calls `_removeBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L161).
4. `removeBid()` tries to [refund Alice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L324-L325). Since Alice has been blackllisted, this will revert.
5. Thus, Alice's bid can not be removed from the bid list even if users are willing to post higher bids.
6. In case Alice has posted multiple bids and exhausted the `maxBids` limit, no further bids can be placed. Since funds from Alice are already collected, she will receive the reserve tokens from the auction & benefit.
7. It may also happen in some cases that due to the inability to remove her bids, the `totalBuyCouponAmount` figure is not reached and the auction fails with `State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD`.

## Mitigation 
Instead of immediately transferring USDC back to the user inside `_removeBid()`, create a mapping and store the eligible refund amount. Create a new function which allows the user to claim this refund amount.
