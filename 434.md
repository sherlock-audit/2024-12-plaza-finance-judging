# [H-2]  NotInAuction modifier incorrect logic could lead to transfering incorrect amount of reserve token to wrong auction

### Summary

When using the ```NotInAuction()``` modifier in the ```Pool.sol``` contract we incorrectly check if the current auction is finished. We take the ```currentPeriod``` from the ```globalPool``` that was already incremented, when we called ```startAuction()```, this would mean that we will always consider that the current auction is is finished as we would check the zero address. This could lead to an issue where the holder of the ```GOV_ROLE``` sets new auction period and distribution period values, that are shorter than the ones of the previous auction that is still running(this is possible as distribution and auction periods may change). This would then mean that we can again use the ```startAuction()``` function to start another auction while the current one is still ongoing. 

(Note that this behavior is possible in the case when we do not call the ```distribute()``` function before a new auction is started using the ```startAuction()``` function without the ```GOV_ROLE``` chaining any of the periods)

This would mean that when we call the ```distribute()```  in ```Pool.sol``` we would only send the amount of coupon tokens from the second auction to the distributor, as we take the coupon amount collected only for the last period auction.

This would then mean that the coupon tokens from the previous(or more than one previous) auction are stuck in the ```Pool.sol``` contract and not all user will be able to claim the coupon tokens the are obligated to from the ````Distributor.pol``` contract. 


### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is in the fact that in the  ```NotInAuction()``` modifier in the ```Pool.sol``` contract we use the ```currentPeriod``` value to check if for the current period we have an active auction(the auction address for the current period in the ```auctions``` mapping is not the zero address). 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L750-L755

This approach is incorrect as currentPeriod gets incremented after we create an auction using the ```startAuction()``` method that is part of the ```Pool.sol``` contract.

This means that the methods listed bellow that are guarded by this modifier can be called at any time and inflict loses to the users of the protocol as mentioned in the scenario that this issue describes.(this is not a malicious behavior form the ```GOV_ROLE``` role holder as the methods are being used as expected - changing periods of auction with the understanding that this periods are modified only if the current auction has completed)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. We have some bondETH  token holders.
2. An Auction is started that is target to have X distribution days and Y period for the auction itself
3. An holder of the GOV_ROLE updates the distribution days and period of the auction calling the ```setAuctionPeriod()``` and ```setDistributionPeriod()``` to something that is smaller than X and Y.
4. A second auction is created that finishes before the first auction
5. Auction number 2 finishes successfully and the ```endAuction()``` is called, reserve tokens are transferred to auction contract and bidders coupon tokens are transferred to the Pool contract.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. We have a pool with some bondETH token holders.
2. An Auction is started that is target to have X distribution days and Y period for the auction itself
3. An holder of the GOV_ROLE updates the distribution days and period of the auction calling the ```setAuctionPeriod()``` and ```setDistributionPeriod()``` to something that is smaller than X and Y.
4. A second auction is created that starts before the first auction finishes.
5. Auction number 2 finishes successfully and the ```endAuction()``` is called, reserve tokens are transferred to auction contract and bidders coupon tokens are transferred to the Pool contract.
6. ```distribute()``` function in ```Pool.sol``` is called, this will transfer only the coupon tokens from the second auction to the ```Distributor``` contract no matter if the first auction already finished or not, as it uses the auction mapping to transfer coupons that were part only from the latest auction that completed.
7. Coupon tokens form the first auction are stuck in the Pool contract(if the auction was successful).
8. Not all users will be able to claim the shares they are obligated to from the Distributor as there are less claimable shares than expected.


### Impact

User of the protocol don't claim the rewards they are obligated to in the form of coupons due to insufficient funds in the Distributor contract.

Coupon tokens generated from Auction would be stuck in the Pool contract in this scenario.

### PoC

This test can be put in the ```Auction.t.sol``` file and ran. Note that in the test we actually do not take advantage of using the ```setDistributionPeriod()``` and ```setAuctionPeriod()``` functions as we use a mocked method to finalize an auction. 

Thought we can clearly see in the ```Pool.sol``` contract ```startAuction()``` method that we can set those values so the required checks are passed and starting an later period auction before an auction from the current period is possible.

Also funds that get transferred to the ```Pool``` contract after the first auction finishes are stuck.

```solidity
  function test_PoCNotAllBondHoldersCanClaimWhenAnLaterPeriodAuctionEndsBeforeAnEralierPeriodOne() public {
    //We define two user of the protocol
    address user1 = address(0x61);
    address user2 = address(0x62);
    Token sharesToken = Token(_pool.couponToken());

    //We define that each user will have 1 bondEthToken
    uint256 usersBondAmount = 1*10**18;
    //Each bondEthToken will be worth 50 shares of the coupon token
    uint256 sharesPerToken = 50*10**18;

    //We now similate that the user have minted a bondEthToken each and the pool has the needed share if coupon token after the shorter auction with an later period has ended
    vm.startPrank(address(_pool));
    _pool.bondToken().mint(user1, usersBondAmount);
    _pool.bondToken().mint(user2, usersBondAmount);

    //We mint the shares of the coupon token that the pool needs to distribute to the users
    sharesToken.mint(address(_pool), 2*sharesPerToken);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(governance);
    //We simulate that two auction for period 1 has finished (auction for period 0 is still ongoing)
    fakeSucceededAuction(address(_pool), 1);

    vm.mockCall(
        address(0),
        abi.encodeWithSignature("state()"),
        abi.encode(uint256(1))
    );

    //We mock the totalBuyCouponAmount returned from the auction will be 2*sharesPerToken which is what is needed to be paid out to users
    vm.mockCall(
      address(0),
      abi.encodeWithSignature("totalBuyCouponAmount()"),
      abi.encode(uint256(2 * sharesPerToken)
    ));

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + params.distributionPeriod);
    // Increase indexed asset period - this is done by Pool when Auction starts but its mocked on this test for readability purposes
    // Note that this is called twice, once for the start of the first auction and once for the start of the second auction
    _pool.bondToken().increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(params.sharesPerToken);
    _pool.bondToken().increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(params.sharesPerToken);
    // We call the distribute function that would send the coupon token to the distributor if the auction for the previos period has successfull ended
    _pool.distribute();
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(user1);
    // User 1 claims the shares he is obligated to (<periods passed> * sharesPerToken) where periods passed is 2 in our case as two auctions were created
    distributor.claim();
    assertEq(sharesToken.balanceOf(user1), 100 * 10**18);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(user2);
    // User 2 tries to claim the shares he is obligated to but the distributor will revert as there aren't enough shares to distribute left in the distributor
    vm.expectRevert(Distributor.NotEnoughSharesBalance.selector);
    distributor.claim();
    assertEq(sharesToken.balanceOf(user2), 0);
    vm.stopPrank();
  }
```
### Mitigation

Add a parameter to the ```distribute()``` function that could be used to pick for what period auction we want to send coupon tokens to the ```Distributor.sol``` contract.
```solidity
uint256 period
```
