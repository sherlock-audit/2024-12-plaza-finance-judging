# `BondToken` holders will lose claim to their share of `couponToken` after calling `Pool::redeem`

### Summary

Bond token holders are supposed to claim shares for each of their bond tokens which is multiplied by the number of periods they held the token. This requires that the protocol keeps track of periods the tokens were held by the user. 

According to the documentation, a user is supposed to be able to claim their shares of coupon tokens for the periods they held even after they cease to hold the tokens. However, when a user redeems their bond token, the burn function is called without updating the period the burn happened. This means that the user will not be able to claim their shares after they redeem their bond tokens

### Root Cause

There is no mechanism to keep track of the period the user redeemed their bond tokens, so after [`Pool::redeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L383C1-L414C4) is called, shares of coupon token is lost. Specifically, the [`BondToken::burn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L135C3-L137C4) function did not call the [`BondToken::_update`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154C3-L164C4) function to track the changes.

### Impact

Users will lose their share of coupon tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `BondToken::burn` function should call the `BondToken::_update`
```diff
      function burn(address account, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
        _burn(account, amount);
      }
+    _update(account, address(0), amount);
```
