# Auction can be forced to succeed and pool reserves emptied beyond `poolLimit`

### Summary

The `sellReserveToken` balance can be manipulated to change the state of the auction.

### Root Cause

When a `endAuction` call is made it can fail if `totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100`

An attacker can enter the pool just before the `endAuction` call is made and increase the `sellReserveToken` balance of the pool. This will force the auction to succeed, bypassing the `poolSaleLimit` and the `totalSellReserveAmount` amount of `reserveToken` to be transferred to the auction for sale.

An attacker would then redeem his pool tokens back to `depositToken` and force a pool to be stuck with a low supply of `reserveToken`. This would break the `poolLimit` as the tokens from the attacker are available in the pool just for a moment so it can pass the `poolSaleLimit` when ending an auction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1.) The attacker deposits a large number of reserve tokens to the pool just before the `endAuction` call and inflates the pool reserves.
2.) The auction ends with success and bypasses the `poolSaleLimit`
3.) The attacker redeems his pool tokens and leaves the pool with a lower reserve than intended.

### Impact

The pool will be left with fewer reserve tokens than intended after the auction ends.

### PoC

1.) Auction starts and users start bidding   
2.) The current state is

```solidity
totalSellReserveAmount = 10 ETH
IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) = 11 ETH
poolSaleLimit = 80%
```

We plug this into the `totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100` check.

```solidity
10 ETH >= 11 ETH * 80%   
10 ETH >= 8.8 ETH --- This requires that 2.2 ETH remain in the pool as enforced by the poolLimit
```

This would make the auction fail with `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`

The attacker sees that and `deposits 5 ETH` to the pool just when the auction is about to end. Plugging that in the equation above:

```solidity
10 ETH >= 16 ETH  * 80%   
10 ETH >= 12.8 ETH ---- is not true so the auction succeeds
```

So the auction succeeded and `10 ETH` was transferred to the auction. The attacker `withdraws 5 ETH` from the pool and the pool is left with `1 ETH` (16 - 10 - 5), instead of `2.2 ETH` (11 - 8.8).

### Mitigation

Cache the reserve token balance of the pool when the auction starts and use that when calculating the `poolLimit` check.
