# Incorrect `reserveCap` Handling in `_deposit()` Allows Overcharging Users

### **Summary**
The lack of synchronization between `amount` adjustment and the `safeTransferFrom` call will cause an **overcharge** for **depositing users**, as the contract will deduct more tokens than the final credited amount due to the adjusted `amount` logic.

---

### **Root Cause**
In the [_deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L118-L134) function, the logic for handling the `reserveCap` can lead to inaccurate `balances` and `reserveAmount` updates:
```solidity
if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
    amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
}
```
If the deposit exceeds the `reserveCap`, the `amount` is reduced to fit the cap, but the user's original `amount` is still transferred from their wallet [using](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L131):

```solidity
IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**
1. A user calls `deposit()` or `_deposit()` with an `amount` such that `reserveAmount + amount > reserveCap`.
2. The `reserveCap` logic adjusts `amount` to fit within the cap.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**
1. The user has sufficient token allowance for the original `amount`.
2. The token contract supports ERC20 `safeTransferFrom`.

---

### **Attack Path**
1. A user calls `deposit()` with an amount exceeding the remaining cap.
2. The contract reduces the `amount` to fit within the `reserveCap`.
3. The `safeTransferFrom` call deducts the original `amount` instead of the adjusted value.
4. The user is overcharged tokens, which are effectively "lost" since they exceed the reserve cap.

---

### **Impact**
The user suffers an approximate loss of the difference between their original deposit `amount` and the adjusted `amount`. This excess is retained by the contract, breaking trust in the deposit process.

---

### **Mitigation**
Ensure the `safeTransferFrom` call uses the **adjusted `amount`**. Move the `safeTransferFrom` call after the `amount` adjustment logic.
