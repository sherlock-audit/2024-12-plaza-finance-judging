# Users can claim their rewards too early, which means that users from the last period may temporarily not be able to claim their rewards

### Summary

Users receive shares for their bondETH when a new period starts, when `startAuction` is called. With these shares, a user can then claim their coupons in the distributor. The problem is that when `startAuction` is called, all users get their shares, but there is no protection against users using these shares from this period at the distributor and claiming coupons before the auction is over. That's not good because the distributor doesn't have the coupons for this period yet because the auction is still running. The users would then receive the coupons from users of the last period if they have not yet claimed all of them. There may then no longer be enough coupons for users from the last period, as they will have to wait until the auction for the current period is finished in order to be able to claim their rewards again.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L190-L199

This is the function that calculates how many shares a user gets for the periods in which they hold bondETH. Here you can see as soon as the period is increased, the user also gets shares for this period, regardless of whether the auction for this period is already over or not.

In the claim function in the distributor you can see that there is no protection against users claiming rewards from users of the last period with shares from this period.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users from the previous period must not have claimed all their coupons before the next period begins.

### External Pre-conditions

There is no interaction with external contracts

### Attack Path

1. Period 0 ends and a successful auction takes place
2. There are 2 users, Alice and Bob. Bob has 10 shares and Alice has 20
3. Bob claims after the distributor has the coupons
4. Afterwards, the distributor still has the 20 coupon tokens for Alice.
5. Period 1 is over, but alice has not claimed yet
6. In period 1 there was a new user charlie who now has 15 shares
7. Charlie claims his 15 shares before the auction for period 1 ends and receives his 15 coupon tokens.
8. The distributor now only has 5 coupon tokens
9. Alice is now trying to claim while the auction for period 1 is not over yet, so this will be reverted because there are no longer 20 coupon tokens but only 5
10. The auction for period 1 fails because there were not enough coupon tokens bid
11. Alice now has to wait a whole quarter until she can claim her coupon tokens


### Impact

Users who do not claim their rewards in the same periodin which you get the shares, run the risk that their rewards will not be available during the next period's auction. Or even longer if the next auction fails, because then these users would have to wait a quarter until the next auction according to the docs (https://docs.plaza.finance/plaza-assets/bondeth-an-ethereum-backed-bond#earning-coupons)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There should be a check in the claim function to ensure that claiming is only possible for shares from past periods where the auction has already ended.
