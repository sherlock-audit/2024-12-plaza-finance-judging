# The `Auction` Contract's `poolSaleLimit` is Set to Over `90%`, Which is Unreasonably High

### Summary

The `Pool.startAuction()` function creates an `Auction` contract with the `poolSaleLimit` parameter set to greater than 90%. This allows the `Auction` contract to sell up to `90%` of the TVL, which could lead to a rapid decline in the `collateralLevel`.

### Root Cause

The [startAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L562) function initializes an `Auction` contract with the `poolSaleLimit` parameter set to over `90%`.

This parameter is intended to limit the sale amount in the `Auction` contract. However, since it is set to greater than 90%, the `Auction` contract can sell `90%` of the TVL, resulting in a rapid decrease in the `collateralLevel`.

```solidity
      function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
        ...

        auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
          address(new Auction()),
          abi.encodeWithSelector(
            Auction.initialize.selector,
            address(couponToken),
            address(reserveToken),
            couponAmountToDistribute,
            block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
            1000,
            address(this),
562         poolSaleLimit
          )
        );

        ...
      }
```

### Attack Path

### Impact

The `Auction` contract can sell `90%` of the TVL, leading to a rapid decline in the `collateralLevel`.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Modify the `Auction` creation as follows:

```diff
      function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
        ...

        auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
          address(new Auction()),
          abi.encodeWithSelector(
            Auction.initialize.selector,
            address(couponToken),
            address(reserveToken),
            couponAmountToDistribute,
            block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
            1000,
            address(this),
-           poolSaleLimit
+           100 - poolSaleLimit
          )
        );

        ...
      }
```
