# Protocol fee amount calculation is inconsistent

### Summary

Plaza implements a protocol fee when a user creates or redeems a derivative token (bond or lev). The fee calculation occurs in the `simulateCreate()` and `simulateRedeem()` functions. The problem arises when the beneficiary or GOV_Role wants to claim the existing fee, instead of getting a proportion of the fee according to when the user creates or redeems, the amount of the fee here depends on the balance of the `reserveToken` in the pool which can have an impact on draining the pool.

### Root Cause

In [Pool.sol:719](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L719) fee calculate again based on balanceOf(adress(this))
