# Incorrect coupon balance check in distributor

#### 1. Brief 
The [allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L116-L125) function in `Distributor.sol` updates the `couponAmountToDistribute` state variable **without verifying** that the contract holds sufficient coupon token balances. This creates a risk where claims may fail if tokens are not properly transferred before invocation.  

#### 2. Description
**Mechanism**:  
- The `allocate` function is designed to increase the `couponAmountToDistribute`, which tracks the total amount of coupon tokens available for distribution.  
- However, the function does **not explicitly check** if the contract’s actual balance of coupon tokens matches or exceeds the allocated amount.  

**Flaw**:  
- If `Pool.distribute` (the caller) fails to transfer coupon tokens to the `Distributor` contract before invoking `allocate`, the `couponAmountToDistribute` will be incremented based on a **false assumption** of token availability.  
- Later, when users attempt to claim their shares via `claim()`, the contract will attempt to transfer tokens that do not exist, causing transactions to revert.  

#### 3. Impact
Users cannot claim their rewards, breaking core protocol functionality. This disrupts user payouts and erodes trust in the protocol.

**Attack Scenario**:  
  1. `Pool.distribute` is called but fails to transfer tokens (e.g., due to insufficient allowance).  
  2. `Distributor.allocate` is still invoked, increasing `couponAmountToDistribute`.  
  3. Users call `claim()`, but the contract lacks tokens, reverting all transactions.  

#### 4. Proof of Concept (PoC)
**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Deploy `Pool` and `Distributor` contracts.  
2. Call `Pool.distribute()` **without** first transferring coupon tokens to `Distributor`.  
3. Observe that `Distributor.allocate()` updates `couponAmountToDistribute` despite zero token balance.  
4. Users call `claim()`, which reverts due to insufficient funds.  

```solidity
// In Distributor.sol (flawed version)
function allocate(uint256 _amountToDistribute) external {
    require(msg.sender == pool, "Caller not Pool");
    couponAmountToDistribute += _amountToDistribute; // No balance check!
}
```

#### 5. Mitigation Steps
1. Add a check in `allocate` to ensure the contract’s coupon token balance is sufficient **after** allocation.  
2. Ensure `Pool.distribute` **always** transfers tokens to `Distributor` **before** calling `allocate`.
