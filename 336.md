# Coupons Are Provided Before Auction is successful.


### Summary
If auction is failed, users who claim coupons later may not receive them even if they were distributed first.

### Root Cause
In the current implementation, coupons are distributed to BondETH owners as soon as the auction starts. 
However, if the auction fails, the coupons will not be sent to the distributor. 
As a result, BondETH owners may not receive their coupons.

### Internal pre-conditions
Aution Fail.

### External pre-conditions
N/A

Pool.sol
    function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
        ...
        auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
            address(new Auction()),
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                Auction.initialize.selector,
                address(couponToken),
                address(reserveToken),
                couponAmountToDistribute,
                block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
                1000,
                address(this),
                poolSaleLimit
            )
        );

        // Increase the bond token period
567:    bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);

        // Update last distribution time
        lastDistribution = block.timestamp;
    }
```  

### Impact
Users who claim coupons later may not receive them even if they were distributed first.

### Mitigation
Consider the providing coupons after auction finished.
