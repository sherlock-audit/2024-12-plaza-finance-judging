# PreDeposit Contract Vulnerability: Attacker Can Exchange Just 1 Reserve for All BondTokens and LeverageTokens

### Summary

In PreDeposit.sol, a user can exchange just 1 reserve for all minted BondTokens and LeverageTokens.

At the start of PreDeposit, an attacker deposits a reserve amount equal to the reserveCap, which prevents other users from depositing. In the final few seconds of the deposit period, the attacker calls the withdraw function to withdraw reserveCap-1 amount of reserves. At this point, the attacker can exchange just 1 reserve amount for all the BondTokens and LeverageTokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The attacker prevents other users from depositing and ultimately exchanges just 1 reserve for all the BondTokens and LeverageTokens.

### PoC


```solidity
// After PreDeposit is deployed, when the deposit begins.
//attacker  call
PreDeposit.deposit(reserveCap)

//Just before the deposit ends, when the time is about to reach depositEndTime.
//attacker  call
PreDeposit.withdraw(reserveCap-1)  // At this point, the deposit is just a few seconds away from ending.
//After the deposit period ends.
PreDeposit.createPool()  
PreDeposit.claim()
```



### Mitigation

Set a time to distinguish between the deposit and withdrawal periods. During the last phase, only deposits should be allowed, and withdrawals should be terminated. This way, even if the attacker withdraws after depositing only 1 reserve amount, the other users will have enough time to deposit, preventing the attacker from acquiring all the bondTokens and leverageTokens with just 1 reserve token.
