# Flawed Security Mechanism in BondETH Withdrawal: Ineffective Safeguards Against Pool Manipulation

### Summary

The security mechanism for withdrawing BondETH is improperly implemented, making it ineffective and allowing easy manipulation of the pool, potentially result to fund losses.
 uint256 private constant PRECISION = 1000000;
  uint256 private constant BOND_TARGET_PRICE = 100;
General Redeem rate maximum can be is `PRECISION * BOND_TARGET_PRICE `  // 100_000_000
But the market rate we are getting with is extra two 0's // 10_000_000_000

The feature is implemented that we will get the `marketRate` and compare with `redeemRate` and take the lower one to save from manipulation. But it is never be used as there is (100:1) ratio difference. So the market rate never be used.

### Root Cause

The issue lies in the function `Pool::simulateRedeem()` in the way we calculating the market rate.

Link: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L443C1-L451C6

```solidity
// Pool::simulateRedeem()
    uint256 marketRate;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(address(bondToken), USD);
    if (feed != address(0)) {
      marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD)
        .normalizeAmount(
          getOracleDecimals(address(bondToken), USD), 
          oracleDecimals // this is the decimals of the reserve token chainlink feed
        );
    }
```
In test `test/BondOracleAdapterTest.t.sol`  we can see the expected values.
```solidity 
function testDecimals() public view {
    assertEq(adapter.decimals(), 18);
  }
```

As per these expected value we can see in test and sponsor confirmed. 
- `getOraclePrice()` : Price in e18 (99e18).
- `getOracleDecimals()` Decimals of feed (18).
-  `oracleDecimals` chainlink feed decimals (8)

The calculation is not in the same ratio as genera redeem rate.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Feed should be available and returning the rate.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This is security feature implemented, as pool taking real time values, It can be manipulated to gain monetary benefits. But as calculation is not done properly as the same ratio as `redeemRate` It never be used and it would never be used. 
- leaves's pool open to be manipulated.

### PoC

These expected values are taken from the  `test/BondOracleAdapterTest.t.sol`  and confirmed by sponsors.

  address USD = address(0x02);

  uint256 private constant PRECISION = 1000000;
  uint256 private constant BOND_TARGET_PRICE = 100;

  uint8 oracleDecimals = 8;


  function testWrongCalculation() public {
    uint generalRedeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;

    // Returning price lower than the target price 99 < 100
    uint marketRate = calc();
    
    // still the marketRate is higher than the generalRedeemRate
    assert(generalRedeemRate < marketRate);

    console.log("generalRedeemRate:", generalRedeemRate);
    console.log("       marketRate:", marketRate);

  }

  function calc() public view returns(uint marketRate) {
      marketRate = getOraclePrice(bondToken, USD)
        .normalizeAmount(
          getOracleDecimals(bondToken, USD), 
          oracleDecimals // this is the decimals of the reserve token chainlink feed
        );
}

  function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns(uint256) {
    return 99e18;
  }

  function getOracleDecimals(address quote, address base) public view returns(uint8 decimals) {
    return 18;
  }


}

```

### Mitigation

Correct the calculation, make the `marketRate` in the same ratio as the `redeemRate`.
