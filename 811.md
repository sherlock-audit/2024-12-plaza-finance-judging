# Deleted Bid Struct Data Used for List Traversal in removeExcessBids() Leads to Invalid Index Usage and Failed Removals

## Summary

There is a linked list pointer corruption vulnerability in the `removeExcessBids()` function. The function caches and uses a bid's `prevIndex` after the bid structure has been deleted:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L250

```solidity
while (currentIndex != 0 && amountToRemove != 0) {
    uint256 prevIndex = currentBid.prevBidIndex;   // Cache value too early
    _removeBid(currentIndex);                      // Delete entire bid struct
    currentIndex = prevIndex;                      // Use deleted value
}
```

This creates several issues:

When `_removeBid()` is called, it deletes the entire bid struct with `delete bids[bidIndex]`:

```solidity
function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
    // ...
    delete bids[bidIndex];
    bidCount--;
}
```

However, the removal loop continues using the cached `prevIndex` from that now-deleted struct:

```solidity
while (currentIndex != 0 && amountToRemove != 0) {
    uint256 prevIndex = currentBid.prevBidIndex;  // Cache from current bid
    _removeBid(currentIndex);                     // Current bid gets deleted
    currentIndex = prevIndex;                     // Use index from deleted bid
}
```

Since this occurs during excess bid removal when `currentCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount`, using these invalid indices means the function may skip or incorrectly remove bids. Each time this happens during a new bid placement, it further degrades the linked list's integrity, preventing proper price-ordered removal of excess bids.

## Impact
When the total bid amount (`currentCouponAmount`) exceeds `totalBuyCouponAmount`, the `removeExcessBids()` function is called during `bid()` to remove the lowest-priced bids that represent the excess. Since `_removeBid()` deletes the entire bid struct but the function continues using a cached `prevIndex` from that deleted struct to traverse upward through the price-ordered list, it likely uses an invalid index for traversal. This can lead to wrong bids being removed, improper handling of the excess amount calculation, and potential infinite loops if the invalid index points back to processed bids, causing the new bid transaction to fail with out of gas. The result is that the auction may retain bids that should have been removed or remove wrong bids, meaning it won't properly maintain the highest-priced bids up to `totalBuyCouponAmount` as intended by the excess removal mechanism.

## Recommended mitigation steps

Cache the next index only after confirming it will be needed:

```solidity
while (currentIndex != 0 && amountToRemove != 0) {
    Bid storage currentBid = bids[currentIndex];
    uint256 sellAmount = currentBid.sellCouponAmount;
    
    if (amountToRemove >= sellAmount) {
        uint256 nextIndex = currentBid.prevBidIndex;
        amountToRemove -= sellAmount;
        _removeBid(currentIndex);
        currentIndex = nextIndex;
    } else {
        // Handle partial removal case
        currentBid.sellCouponAmount = sellAmount - amountToRemove;
        currentCouponAmount -= amountToRemove;
        uint256 proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellAmount;
        uint256 reserveReduction = (currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18;
        currentBid.buyReserveAmount -= reserveReduction;
        totalSellReserveAmount -= reserveReduction;
        amountToRemove = 0;
    }
}
```

This ensures list pointers remain valid during traversal while maintaining the original excess bid removal logic.
