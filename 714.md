# Large redeems before fee claims reduce collectible fees

### Summary

Due to the way the fee amount calculation, protocol may loose fees if there are large redeems before the call to `claimFees`.

### Root Cause

`getFeeAmount` function calculates the fee amount by taking into account the current `reserveToken` balance and time passed since the last claim. When users are interacting the fees are charged indirectly by reducing the `poolReserves` amount which will affect the redeem and create rates. The fee is kept in the contract balance and only deducted when permissioned role calls `claimFees`.  This results in a situation where there are large redeems that decrease the `reserveToken ` balance of the contract significantly  and therefore the fee protocol is entitled to will be reduced.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Comparing 2 cases where the loss of fees can be observed:

Case 1 (No withdrawal):
- Reserves: 1000 tokens
- Time: 30 days
- Fee ≈ 0.82 tokens

Case 2 (50% withdrawal):
- Reserves: 500 tokens
- Time: 30 days
- Fee ≈ 0.41 tokens

### Impact

Protocol gets less fee amount than it should.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Have a variable that tracks fee amount and claim that amount instead.
