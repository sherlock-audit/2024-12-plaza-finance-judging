# The param `totalSellReserveAmount` is not validated after auction ends

## Summary

After a successful auction, the `totalSellReserveAmount` of reserve tokens is transferred from the pool to the auction. However, this value is not validated, allowing the auction to receive more reserve tokens than intended.

## Root Cause

After the auction concludes, the [endAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336-L350) function in `Auction.sol` is invoked.

This function checks whether `currentCouponAmount` is less than `totalBuyCouponAmount`, but it does not validate the `totalSellReserveAmount`. It then calls the `Pool.transferReserveToAuction()` function to transfer the `totalSellReserveAmount` of reserve tokens from the pool.

```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

In addition, the [transferReserveToAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L577-L583) function in `Pool.sol` does not validate the value of `amount`.

```solidity
  function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```

As a result, any bidder can claim reserve tokens for their bid regardless of the price. The conditions for success are that `currentCouponAmount` is not less than `totalBuyCouponAmount` and that `totalSellReserveAmount` is less than 0.9 times the reserve tokens in the pool. This allows auctions to succeed easily without regard to bid prices.

Consequently, the pool may transfer more reserve tokens to the auction than intended, leading to a loss of funds for the protocol.

## Attack Path


## Impact

The pool transfers more reserve tokens to the auction than intended, resulting in a financial loss for the protocol.

## Mitigation

Implement validation for `totalSellReserveAmount` or establish a minimum price requirement for bidders to ensure fair auction outcomes.
