# Oracle pool can be misconfigured on deployment.

### Summary

When deploying `BondOracleAdapter.sol`, `dexPool`  can be **misconfigured** due to front-run (not necessarily in the same block).  

**Note**: if this is a valid issue, please don't report it under my github handler, but with my Watson name **Hurley** or **0xHurley**!

### Root Cause

When deploying `BondOracleAdapter.sol`, the `dexPool` address is fetched with `getPool()`. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L120-L138

However to get the pool, the function "**scroll**" through all possible pool in Aerodrome with tokenA and tokenB, depending on tickSpacing, starting from 1 (then 50, 100 etc.). 

If the targeted pool isn't the one with `tickspacing=1`, an attacker can deploy a pool with same tokens and `tickspacing=1`just before the deployment of `BondOracleAdapter.sol`. And then, the pool used will be the wrong one, which can lead to **Oracle Price Manipulation** and all this kind of vulnerabilities.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker front-run `BondOracleAdapter.sol` and deploy a pool with same tokens and a `tickspacing = 1`.
2. `BondOracleAdapter.sol` is deployed with wrong pool. 

### Impact

As the wrong pool might be used for Oracle, this leave the door open to all oracle classic vulnerabilities like **Oracle Price Manipulations**.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of scrolling to fetch the address, deploy `BondOracleAdapter.sol` using the chosen address directly.
