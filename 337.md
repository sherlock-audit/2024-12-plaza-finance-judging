# Incorrect Protocol Fees


### Summary
Protocol fees can significantly based on the frequency of fee claims.
This is leading to financial losses for the protocol or the users.

### Root Cause
The frequency of fee claims can lead to reduced fees if claims are made too often. 
This is because the protocol charges fees even for amounts of fees it does not collect.

```solidity
Pool.sol
    function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
719:    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
    }
    function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
        require(msg.sender == feeBeneficiary || poolFactory.hasRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE(), msg.sender), NotBeneficiary());
        uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();
        
        if (feeAmount == 0) {
            revert NoFeesToClaim();
        }
        
708:    lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
        
        emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
    }

### PoC
Assuming:
reserveAmount = 1000e18
fee = 80000 (8%)
Time1 = lastFeeClaimTime + SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 2
Time2 = lastFeeClaimTime + SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 4

Case 1: Claim Fees at Time2
    feeAmount1 = 1000e18 * 80000 * (SECONDS_PER_YEAR/2) / (1000000 * SECONDS_PER_YEAR) = 40e18;
Case 2: Claim Fees at Time1 and then Time2
    First Claim at Time1:
        feeAmount2_1 = 1000e18 * 80000 * (SECONDS_PER_YEAR/4) / (1000000 * SECONDS_PER_YEAR) = 20e18;
    Second Claim at Time2:
        feeAmount2_2 = (1000e18 - 20e18) * 80000 * (SECONDS_PER_YEAR/2 - SECONDS_PER_YEAR/4) / (1000000 * SECONDS_PER_YEAR) = 19.6e18;
    feeAmount2 = feeAmount2_1 + feeAmount2_2 = 39.6e18; 
In this scenario, feeAmount2 (39.9e18) is less than feeAmount1 (40e18) by 0.4e18(1% of total fee and more than $300). 
Depending on your perspective, this represents a loss for one side in the protocol and the users.

- Serverity Clarify
In sherlock doc:
>IV. How to identify a high issue:
>Users lose more than 1% and more than $10 of their yield.
>The protocol loses more than 1% and more than $10 of the fees.

- Duplication Clarify
This is not a duplicate of the loss resulting from not charging a fee. 
The root cause of this report lies in the fee calculation formula.

### Impact
The accounting within the protocol is compromised because the settlement of fees is influenced by how frequently claims are made. This variability can lead to financial losses for either the protocol or the users.

### Mitigation
Consider using the following formula:
`feeAmount = totalBalnce - totalBalnce * pow(1 - fee / SECONDS_PER_YEAR, elapsedSeconds)`
Additionally, the fee should be updated before any changes to the `totalBalance`.
