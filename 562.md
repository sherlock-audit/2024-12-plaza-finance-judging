# `OracleReader:getOraclePrice` Does Not Verify If the Returned Price Is Outside the `Min/Max` Range

### Summary


If the price returned by `getOraclePrice` is manipulated or incorrect, it can have severe impacts, and a malicious user could exploit it in the following ways:


```solidity
  function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns(uint256) {
    bool isInverted = false;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(quote, base);
    
    if (feed == address(0)) {
      feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(base, quote);
      if (feed == address(0)) {
        revert NoFeedFound();
      }

      // Invert the price
      isInverted = true;
    }
    (,int256 answer,,uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
    
    if (updatedTimestamp + OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).feedHeartbeats(feed) < block.timestamp) {
      revert StalePrice();
    }

    uint256 decimals = uint256(AggregatorV3Interface(feed).decimals());
    return isInverted ? (10 ** decimals * 10 ** decimals) / uint256(answer) : uint256(answer);
  }
```

### **Impact on `create` Function**
The `create` function allows users to mint new **BOND** or **LEVERAGE** tokens by depositing reserve tokens. The amount of tokens minted is calculated using the `simulateCreate` function, which relies on the price returned by `getOraclePrice` for the reserve token.

#### **Exploit Scenario**
- If the oracle price is **manipulated to be lower** than the actual market price of the reserve token:
  - The protocol will think the deposited reserve tokens have less value than they actually do.
  - The amount of BOND or LEVERAGE tokens minted for the same deposit will be **reduced**.
  - This harms regular users by providing them with less value for their deposits.

- If the oracle price is **manipulated to be higher** than the actual market price of the reserve token:
  - The protocol will think the deposited reserve tokens are worth more than they actually are.
  - A **malicious user can mint an excessive amount of BOND or LEVERAGE tokens for a small deposit**.
  - This inflates the supply of these derivative tokens and dilutes the pool's collateral.

#### **Impact**
- **For users:** Lower oracle prices result in fewer tokens minted, leading to unfair outcomes.
- **For the protocol:** Higher oracle prices allow malicious users to extract more value than they contribute, potentially draining the pool's reserves and destabilizing the protocol.


### **Impact on `redeem` Function**
The `redeem` function allows users to burn BOND or LEVERAGE tokens to withdraw reserve tokens from the pool. The amount of reserve tokens received is calculated using the `simulateRedeem` function, which also relies on `getOraclePrice`.

#### **Exploit Scenario**
- If the oracle price is **manipulated to be lower** than the actual market price of the reserve token:
  - The protocol will think the reserve token is worth less than it actually is.
  - A **malicious user can redeem more reserve tokens for the same amount of BOND or LEVERAGE tokens**.
  - This drains the pool's reserves and harms other users.

- If the oracle price is **manipulated to be higher** than the actual market price of the reserve token:
  - The protocol will think the reserve token is worth more than it actually is.
  - Users redeeming BOND or LEVERAGE tokens will receive **fewer reserve tokens than they should**, resulting in unfair losses.

#### **Impact**
- **For users:** Higher oracle prices lead to fewer reserve tokens being redeemed, resulting in losses for legitimate users.
- **For the protocol:** Lower oracle prices allow malicious users to withdraw more reserve tokens than they should, potentially draining the pool's reserves and destabilizing the protocol.



also we used this function `BalancerOracleAdapter:latestRoundData` to get the price of the pool assets and based on that prices we calculated the _calculateFairUintPrice.


### **Impact of Incorrect Oracle Prices in the BalancerOracleAdpater**

1. **Overvaluation of Assets**:
   - If the oracle price is artificially inflated, the pool's valuation will be overestimated.
   - A malicious user could exploit this by **creating more shares or redeeming for a larger amount of assets** than they should be entitled to.

2. **Undervaluation of Assets**:
   - If the oracle price is artificially deflated, the pool's valuation will be underestimated.
   - Honest users redeeming their shares might receive **less value than they are entitled to**, causing financial loss.


```solidity
 function latestRoundData()
    external
    view
    returns (uint80, int256, uint256, uint256, uint80){
    IBalancerV2WeightedPool pool = IBalancerV2WeightedPool(poolAddress);
    VaultReentrancyLib.ensureNotInVaultContext(IVault(pool.getVault()));
    (IERC20[] memory tokens,,) = IVault(pool.getVault()).getPoolTokens(pool.getPoolId());
    
    //get weights
    uint256[] memory weights = pool.getNormalizedWeights(); // 18 dec fractions
    uint256[] memory prices = new uint256[](tokens.length);
    uint8 oracleDecimals;
    for(uint8 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
      oracleDecimals = getOracleDecimals(address(tokens[i]), USD);
@>>      prices[i] = getOraclePrice(address(tokens[i]), USD).normalizeAmount(oracleDecimals, decimals); // balancer math works with 18 dec
    }

    uint256 fairUintUSDPrice = _calculateFairUintPrice(prices, weights, pool.getInvariant(), pool.getActualSupply());

    if (fairUintUSDPrice > uint256(type(int256).max)) {
      revert PriceTooLargeForIntConversion();
    }

    return (uint80(0), int256(fairUintUSDPrice), block.timestamp, block.timestamp, uint80(0));
  }
```


### Root Cause

These tokens are used in the protocol based on the README:
> Standard ERC20. Tokens allowed are set by governance. We will initially use tokens like WETH, USDC, wstETH, WBTC, cbBTC.



Below is the `cbBTC/USD` price feed example used by the protocol on base, which returns minAnswer:

https://basescan.org/address/0x52A12E019826C53B1f7Fd3E6D9546c0935377B95#readContract

In the `getOraclePrice`, the code does not validate the `minAnswer` for specific tokens, nor does it revert when the oracle provides this value.

### Mitigation


Retrieve both the `minPrice` and `maxPrice` from the Chainlink aggregator and compare them with the returned price. Revert the transaction if the price falls outside the allowed bounds.
