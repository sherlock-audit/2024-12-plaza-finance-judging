# Precision loss in `Pool::getRedeemAmount` will result in users redeeming less collateral than they should

### Summary

Precision loss in [`Pool::getRedeemAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L513-L514) will result in users redeeming less collateral than they should. This is due to the following calculation:
```solidity
 redeemRate =
                ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) *
                PRECISION;
```
This formula is used when user wants to redeem his collateral for `levETH` token and the `collateralLevel` is above 1,2. The formula itself is correct, but the place of the `PRECISION` must be before the deviation sign like this:
```solidity
redeemRate =
                ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) *
                PRECISION/ assetSupply) ;
```
This is because of the precision loss possibility and the fact that `tvl - TotalBondValue` is 18 decimals and `assetSupply` of `levETH` is 18 decimals, leaving little to no room for precision, which leads to users redeeming less money than they should

### Root Cause

The misplaced `PRECISION` constant, which should be right before the deviation sign

### Internal Pre-conditions

User wanting to redeem `levETH` and collateral level being above 1,2

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Users receive less `reserveToken` than they should and the slippage protection doesn't mitigate this at all, since this happens in general

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

move the `PRECISION` constant right before the deviation sign
