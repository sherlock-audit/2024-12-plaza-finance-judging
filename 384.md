### Summary

Issue Description:
There is a potential scenario where tokens might become permanently locked within the Distributor and Auction contracts.

Distributor Contract:

Auction Contract:

Similarly, if users fail to call the claimBid method in the Auction contract after a completed auction, tokens associated with winning bids will remain locked.
