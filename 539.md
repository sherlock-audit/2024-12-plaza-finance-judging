# Users can manipulate distribution by depositing

### Summary

Issue 3.9 from previous audit is not fixed - users can manipulate distribution by calling `deposit`.



### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L87)

Coupon amount to distribute is based on the current user's balance. Malicious user can in the same block first call `create()` with large asset amount to receive large `BOND` amount, next call `claim()` and claim all coupons from distribution and then redeem all `BOND` tokens.

```solidity
uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Amelie holds only 1 `BOND` so she can claim only 1 coupon, coupon amount to distribute = 100;
2. Amelie deposits some asset amount and receives 99 `BOND`, now she can claim 100 coupons;
3. Because coupon amount to distribute is fixed, other bondholders are unable to claim their legitimate coupons, because all coupons were already claimed by Amelie.


### Impact

Users may deposit during distribution to acquire more bond tokens in order to be able to claim more coupon tokens.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not use `balanceOf()` to determine how much users can claim because it can be manipulated.
