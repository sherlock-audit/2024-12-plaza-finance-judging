# Auction settlement affects bond and leverage token creation and redemption in Pool contract

### Summary

The `Pools.sol` contract provides `create()` and `redeem()` method for bond and leverage token creation and redemption respectively. It directly depends upon the amount of reserve tokens in the Pool contract. When an auction starts it resets the `lastDistribution = block.timestamp`. Now, new bond and leverage tokens are getting created as the auction is going for the previous period. But as soon as auction ends `transferReserveToAuction()` sends reserve tokens to `Auction.sol` contract. Which leads to drastic decrease in tvl.

```solidity
@=> uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
    uint256 collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
    uint256 creationRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;

    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }
      creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      if (assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }

      uint256 adjustedValue = tvl - (BOND_TARGET_PRICE * bondSupply);
      creationRate = (adjustedValue * PRECISION) / assetSupply;
    }
```

```solidity
@=> uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
    uint256 assetSupply = bondSupply;
    uint256 multiplier = POINT_EIGHT;

    // Calculate the collateral level based on the token type
    uint256 collateralLevel;
    if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND) {
      collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
    } else {
      multiplier = POINT_TWO;
      assetSupply = levSupply;
      collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);

      if (assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }
    }
```

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- In `create()` flow the creation rate will decrease which will inflate the minting of bond and leverage tokens drastically.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L343
```solidity
return ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
```

- In `redeem()` form the redemption rate will decrease which will decrease the redemption tokens.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L524
```solidity
return ((depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) / ethPrice) / PRECISION;
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Currently the pool reserves are calculated as current balance of reserve tokens in Pool.sol contract. If it is expected then atleast block minting and redemption until previous Auction is complete
