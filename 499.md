# Pool can never be deployed through preDeposit due to this bug

### Summary

After preDeposit duration ends, pool is created with the reserves taken during pre deposit duration. If there will be no reserve tokens then pool will not be created.

```solidity
 function createPool() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
@>  if (reserveAmount == 0) revert NoReserveAmount();
    if (bondAmount == 0 || leverageAmount == 0) revert InvalidBondOrLeverageAmount();
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
    IERC20(params.reserveToken).approve(address(factory), reserveAmount);
    pool = factory.createPool(params, reserveAmount, bondAmount, leverageAmount, bondName, bondSymbol, leverageName, leverageSymbol, true);

    emit PoolCreated(pool);
    poolCreated = true;
  }
```
See the attack path for example.

### Root Cause

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- PreDeposit is started for a period with some reserve cap.
- Attacker will deposit full reserves till the reserve cap so no one can deposit now.
- Just before the end of the deposit duration(some timestamp before end), attacker will withdraw all his reserves.
- Now duration period is completed and there will be no reserves.
- Thats why pool will not be deployed.
- This can be done by the attacker in every predoposit pool and can be done everytime so pool will never be deployed.

### Impact

Any pool cannot be deployed through preDeposit contract so that this functionalities will not work ever.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Protocol have to find a way to properly utilise preDeposit functionalities so that such attacks will not happen and pool can be deployed safely.
