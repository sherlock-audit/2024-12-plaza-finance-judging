# Missing initialization of Pausable functionality in `Auction` contract

### Summary

The `initialize` function in the `Auction` contract is missing the call to `__Pausable_init()`, which is necessary to properly initialize the `PausableUpgradeable` functionality. This oversight can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities, as the pause functionality will not work correctly.

### Root Cause

The `Auction` contract inherits from `PausableUpgradeable` but does not call `__Pausable_init()` in its `initialize` function. This means that the internal state variables of `PausableUpgradeable` are not set up correctly, leading to potential issues with the contract's pause and unpause mechanisms.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/PausableUpgradeable.sol";

contract Auction is PausableUpgradeable {
    // ...existing code...

    function initialize(
        address _buyCouponToken,
        address _sellReserveToken,
        uint256 _totalBuyCouponAmount,
        uint256 _endTime,
        uint256 _maxBids,
        address _beneficiary,
        uint256 _poolSaleLimit
    ) initializer public {
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        // Missing __Pausable_init();
        // ...existing initialization code...
    }

    function placeBid() public whenNotPaused {
        // Function logic
    }

    function emergencyPause() public onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }

    function resume() public onlyOwner {
        _unpause();
    }
}
```

### Impact

The missing initialization of `PausableUpgradeable` can lead to the following issues:
- The contract cannot be paused or unpaused, rendering the pause functionality ineffective.
- Functions protected by `whenNotPaused` and `whenPaused` modifiers may not behave as expected.
- Increased risk of security vulnerabilities, as the contract cannot be paused in case of an emergency.

### PoC

To demonstrate the vulnerability, we can deploy the contract and attempt to use the pause functionality without initializing `PausableUpgradeable`.
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/Auction.sol";

contract AuctionTest is Test {
    Auction auction;

    function setUp() public {
        auction = new Auction();
        auction.initialize(
            0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678, // _buyCouponToken
            0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12, // _sellReserveToken
            1000, // _totalBuyCouponAmount
            block.timestamp + 1 days, // _endTime
            10, // _maxBids
            0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdef, // _beneficiary
            95000 // _poolSaleLimit
        );
    }

    function testPauseFunctionality() public {
        vm.expectRevert("Pausable: paused");
        auction.emergencyPause();
    }
}
```
When running the provided test on Foundry, the output will show that the emergencyPause function fails due to the missing initialization of `PausableUpgradeable`. Here is the output:
```bash
Running 1 test for src/test/AuctionTest.sol:AuctionTest
[FAIL. Reason: Pausable: paused] testPauseFunctionality() (gas: 4568)
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, ensure that `__Pausable_init()` is called in the `initialize` function:
```solidity
function initialize(
    address _buyCouponToken,
    address _sellReserveToken,
    uint256 _totalBuyCouponAmount,
    uint256 _endTime,
    uint256 _maxBids,
    address _beneficiary,
    uint256 _poolSaleLimit
) initializer public {
    __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
    __Pausable_init();
    // ...existing initialization code...
}
```
