# Attacker will cause reserve asset loss for protocol due to incorrect lowest bid tracking

### Summary

In `Auction.sol#L238-244`, an inverted comparison when updating the lowest bid index will cause reserve asset loss for the protocol as attackers can manipulate bid removal priorities. The flawed logic miscalculates bid price comparisons when determining the lowest bid, causing the protocol to retain economically unfavorable bids while removing better offers when auction capacity is reached, forcing suboptimal reserve asset exchange rates. 

### Root Cause

**In [`Auction.sol#L238-244`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L238-L244), the comparison logic for updating `lowestBidIndex` reverses the bid price ratio, causing economically harmful bids to be retained:** 

```solidity
// Incorrect comparison in Auction.sol#L238-244
leftSide = newSellCouponAmount * lowestBuyReserveAmount;
rightSide = lowestSellCouponAmount * newBuyReserveAmount;

if (leftSide < rightSide || (leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount < lowestSellCouponAmount)) {
    lowestBidIndex = newBidIndex;
}
```

The code attempts to compare bids using the ratio `buyReserveAmount / sellCouponAmount` (reserve tokens per coupon token) to determine the "lowest" bid (least favorable to the protocol). However, the multiplication terms are inverted:

- **Correct Comparison**:  
  Should compute `(newBuyReserveAmount * existingSellCouponAmount) < (existingBuyReserveAmount * newSellCouponAmount)` to identify bids with **lower reserve/coupon ratios** (worse prices).

- **Actual Flawed Comparison**:  
  Computes `(newSellCouponAmount * existingBuyReserveAmount) < (existingSellCouponAmount * newBuyReserveAmount)`, which is equivalent to comparing `newSellCouponAmount / newBuyReserveAmount < existingSellCouponAmount / existingBuyReserveAmount` (coupon tokens per reserve token).

This causes bids with **lower reserve/coupon ratios** (e.g., *1 ETH for 500 USDC*) to be incorrectly classified as "better" than bids with higher ratios (e.g., *1.5 ETH for 300 USDC*). During bid removal (e.g., when `maxBids` is reached), higher-value bids are purged while economically unfavorable bids are retained, forcing the protocol to accept suboptimal exchange rates. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **At least two bids with different reserve/coupon ratios must exist** - The protocol must receive bids where one offers a better reserve/coupon ratio (e.g., 1.5 ETH for 300 USDC) and another a worse ratio (e.g., 1 ETH for 500 USDC).
2. **Bid count must exceed `maxBids`** - The auction must receive more bids than allowed by `maxBids`, forcing the removal of the "lowest" bid.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Legitimate bids with identical reserve/coupon ratios are placed**  
   - Bid 1: `300 USDC` (`sellCouponAmount`) for `1.5 ETH` (`buyReserveAmount` → Ratio: **0.005 ETH/USDC**).  
   - Bid 2: `200 USDC` for `1 ETH` (Ratio: **0.005 ETH/USDC**).  

2. **Initial `lowestBidIndex` is set to Bid 2**  
   - Secondary condition (`newSellCouponAmount < lowestSellCouponAmount`) prioritizes Bid 2 as `lowestBidIndex`.

3. **Attacker places suboptimal Bid 3 (flawed logic triggers here)**  
   - Bid 3: `500 USDC` (`sellCouponAmount`) for `1 ETH` (`buyReserveAmount` → Ratio: **0.002 ETH/USDC**).  
   - **Flawed Comparison**:  
     ```solidity
     // Auction.sol#L238-244 for Bid 3 insertion
     leftSide = 500 USDC * 1 ETH (Bid 2's buyReserveAmount) = 500
     rightSide = 200 USDC * 1 ETH (Bid 3's buyReserveAmount) = 200
     // leftSide (500) > rightSide (200) → Condition fails
     ```
     - **Result**: Bid 3 is **not** marked as `lowestBidIndex` despite offering less ETH per USDC.

4. **Auction exceeds `maxBids = 2`, removes Bid 2 (not Bid 3)**  
   - Protocol removes `lowestBidIndex` (Bid 2: `200 USDC` for `1 ETH`), retaining Bid 3 (`500 USDC` for `1 ETH`).  

5. **Protocol retains attacker’s suboptimal Bid 3**  
   - Final active bids: Bid 1 (`300 USDC` for `1.5 ETH`) and Bid 3 (`500 USDC` for `1 ETH`).  

6. **Auction concludes with unfavorable terms**  
   - Protocol **sells** `800 USDC` (Bid 1: 300 + Bid 3: 500) to **buy** `2.5 ETH` (1.5 + 1).  
   - **Fair Value Comparison**:  
     - At market rate (0.005 ETH/USDC), 800 USDC should yield **4 ETH** (800 * 0.005).  
     - Actual outcome yields **2.5 ETH** → **Protocol loses 1.5 ETH** due to retained suboptimal bid.  

### Impact

**The protocol suffers a direct loss of reserve assets (e.g., ETH) proportional to the difference between the attacker's suboptimal bid rate and the fair market rate.**  

### Example Quantification:
- **Scenario**:  
  - Protocol sells **800 USDC** (coupon tokens) via two bids:  
    - Bid 1: `300 USDC` → `1.5 ETH` (fair rate: **0.005 ETH/USDC**).  
    - Attacker's Bid 3: `500 USDC` → `1 ETH` (exploited rate: **0.002 ETH/USDC**).  
  - **Total ETH Received**: `1.5 + 1 = 2.5 ETH`.  
- **Fair Value Expectation**:  
  - At market rate (`0.005 ETH/USDC`), `800 USDC` should yield **4 ETH** (`800 × 0.005`).  
- **Loss**:  
  - **1.5 ETH** deficit (4 ETH - 2.5 ETH) → **~$4,500 loss** at $3,000/ETH.  

### Systemic Risk:
Repeated exploitation across auctions could drain the protocol’s reserve assets, destabilizing its economic model and eroding user trust in the bidding mechanism.

### Mitigation

**Fix the primary comparison while retaining the correct secondary condition for tie-breaking:**

```solidity
// Corrected comparison in Auction.sol#L238-244
leftSide = newBuyReserveAmount * lowestSellCouponAmount; // newBuy * existingSell
rightSide = lowestBuyReserveAmount * newSellCouponAmount; // existingBuy * newSell

if (leftSide < rightSide || (leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount < lowestSellCouponAmount)) {
    lowestBidIndex = newBidIndex;
}
```
