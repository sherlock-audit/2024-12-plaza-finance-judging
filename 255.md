# Auction is using push over pull

### Summary

Currently in `Auction.sol`, if the `totalBuyCouponAmount` is reached, one of the bids that are currently in the auction will be removed. The problem comes from this that the current implementation is using push over pull and couponToken could be USDC, which can blacklist users.

### Root Cause

The current implementation uses a push model when removing bids once the `totalBuyCouponAmount` limit is reached. This model has the potential risk of involving blacklisted users. If a user is blacklisted all requests will be DOSed, because tokens can't be transferred and the bidding process will not work.

### Impact

This will lead to the following two problems:
1) New users can't join the auction.
2) Protocol will pay more, because new bidsed can't join the auction and this will lead to bigger sellReserveAmount.

### PoC

Let's have the following scenario:
1. User A places a bid in the auction using USDC.
2. User A is maliciously blacklisted by USDC, which prevents their funds from being transferred.
3. The auction reaches the cap for totalBuyCouponAmount, and User A's bid needs to be removed to make room for new bids.
However, because User A is blacklisted, the bid cannot be removed, preventing the auction from accepting new bids.
As a result, the auction becomes stuck with the old bids, and new users cannot join or place bids.

### Mitigation

Create another method, where users can claim their refunded amounts from the removal of bids.
