# A malicious actor can interfere with the conclusion of the auction.

### Summary

At the conclusion of the Auction, an attacker can exploit the redeem() function in Pool.sol to deposit a large amount of bond tokens and withdraw a significant quantity of reserve tokens. Subsequently, they can call the endAuction() function in Auction.sol, causing the auction to fail with the "FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT" state due to the withdrawal of a large amount of reserve tokens from Pool.sol.Once the auction fails, it cannot be restarted.

### Root Cause

At the conclusion of the auction, we check the reserve token amount present in the Pool.sol contract as specified in [(Auction.sol:341)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341). This amount can be manipulated by a malicious actor. Anyone can call the endAuction() function to end the Auction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

1. The block.timestamp value should be greater than the Auction end time.

### Attack Path

1. The Attacker waits for the block.timestamp to satisfy the conditions 
2. The Attacker calls the redeem() function ([(pool.sol:353)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L353)) with large quantity of depositAmount thereby altering the reserve token(decreasing the reserve token)
3. Then call the endAuction() function ([(Auction.sol:336)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336C12-L336C22))in Auction.sol to make the Auction fail.

### Impact

The Auction will fail and users will not be able to claim the reserve token they bid for they can only get a refund of the coupon amount. Ultimately wasting the gas fees for all the bidders in the Auction.sol. The Auction then needs to be conducted again.
