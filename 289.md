# Underflow Error in getOraclePrice Function when AggregatorV3Interface Returns a Negative Value

### Summary

The getOraclePrice function within the OracleReader contract relies on the AggregatorV3Interface to retrieve price data from external oracle feed. When the value returned from latestRoundData() is negative value or Zero, the subsequent calculation would cause an error in implementation including underflow and erroneous results in the Plaza protocol. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L68-L75
```solidity
function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns(uint256) {
    bool isInverted = false;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(quote, base);
    
    if (feed == address(0)) {
      feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(base, quote);
      if (feed == address(0)) {
        revert NoFeedFound();
      }

      // Invert the price
      isInverted = true;
    }
>>>    (,int256 answer,,uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
    
    if (updatedTimestamp + OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).feedHeartbeats(feed) < block.timestamp) {
      revert StalePrice();
    }

    uint256 decimals = uint256(AggregatorV3Interface(feed).decimals());
>>>    return isInverted ? (10 ** decimals * 10 ** decimals) / uint256(answer) : uint256(answer);
  }
```
The issue stems from the use of the value returned by AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData() as noted in the pointers in the getOraclePrice(...) function above, specifically the `answer` variable, which is an int256. When the value of answer is negative, the function attempts to perform arithmetic operations on it without proper validation. The calculation involves multiplying  values (10 ** decimals * 10 ** decimals), and dividing by answer. The problem is that the code attempts to type cast the value of answer to uint256 regardless of if it is negative or not, when it is negative the typecasting does not revert instead its underflows to a completely different value which cause return of completely wrong price and can be used to steal fund from the contract by a bad actor monitoring the prices returned after this underflow.


### Attack Path

The attacker monitors the  AggregatorV3Interface feed for when it returns a negative value
- Then the Arithmetic error due to the interaction between negative values and unsigned integers (uint256).
- Incorrect price calculations which the attacker uses to clear fund.

### Impact

- Incorrect Price Calculation: When the oracle feed returns a negative value, the OracleReader contract will perform erroneous calculations,  leading to incorrect price reports and financial inaccuracies with fund loss to protocol.
- Loss of Fund to Innocent users who would be affected by this error in price calculation
### PoC

```solidity
function NegativeValueTypeCast(int256 test) external pure returns (uint256) {
            return uint256(test);
    }
```
A simple test on remix shows that calling the function with a negative value to typecast it to uint256 makes it underflow and returns a completely different result i.e calling with 67 returns 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639869 which will be the same case in the OracleReader contract when getOraclePrice is called with a negative answer value from AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData().

### Mitigation

Protocol can correct this issue by ensuring validation of answer from AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData() to ensure it reverts when it is a negative value or zero before any arithmetic operations is performed on the oracle price (answer), as provided below
```solidity
function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns(uint256) {
    bool isInverted = false;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(quote, base);
    
    if (feed == address(0)) {
      feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(base, quote);
      if (feed == address(0)) {
        revert NoFeedFound();
      }

      // Invert the price
      isInverted = true;
    }
    (,int256 answer,,uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
+++ if (answer <= 0) {
+++    revert InvalidPrice();
+++ }
...
}
```
