# insertSortedBid()

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L177
Due to the opposite sorting order inside the contract, removeExcessBids mistakenly identifies higher-priced bids as the lowest, removing or reducing them first. This allows an attacker to flood the auction with artificially low-priced bids at the last minute, push the auction over its limit, and eliminate normal or higher-priced competitors. As a result, they can secure the auctioned asset at a significantly lower price

### Root Cause

1.	Intended Behavior:
The contract is designed to sort bids in descending order by price (buyAmount / sellAmount):
	•	If a new bid has a higher price, it should be inserted earlier.
	•	If the total auctioned amount (currentCouponAmount) exceeds totalBuyCouponAmount, the contract should remove the lowest-priced bids first.
2.	Actual Implementation Issue:
The contract misuses cross-multiplication in insertSortedBid:
```solidity
// Pseudo-code: The intended comparison is (newBuy * curSell) vs (curBuy * newSell)
// But the actual implementation mistakenly compares (newSell * curBuy) vs (curSell * newBuy), reversing the order.
leftSide  = newSellAmount * currentBuyAmount;
rightSide = currentSellAmount * newBuyAmount;
if (leftSide > rightSide) { 
    // The contract mistakenly considers the new bid to have a higher price
}
```
This effectively sorts lower-priced bids at the front, and the lowestBidIndex often incorrectly points to the highest-priced bid.
Final Effect: When removeExcessBids is triggered, the contract is supposed to remove the lowest-priced bids first. However, due to the reversed sorting logic, it removes the actual highest bids instead.
	In other words, incorrect sorting + backward deletion = The attacker can manipulate their bids to force better bids out of the auction.

### Attack Path

The following is a typical strategy for eliminating higher-priced competitors in the final auction stage, allowing the attacker to win at a much lower cost.

1. The Attacker’s Initial Setup
	•	After the auction starts, honest participants place bids at reasonable or slightly higher prices (buy/sell ratios).
	•	Normally, these higher-priced bids should remain at the front of the list and not be easily removed.

2. The Attacker Places “Reversed” Bids
	•	As the auction nears its end, the attacker calculates the difference between totalBuyCouponAmount and the contract’s currentCouponAmount.
	•	They then deliberately place bids with extremely low prices (newBuy / newSell is very small).
	•	Due to the incorrect sorting logic, these low-priced bids are mistakenly placed at the front of the list.
	•	These bids also quickly push currentCouponAmount over the allowed limit.

3. Triggering removeExcessBids
	•	Once currentCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount, the contract calls removeExcessBids, which starts removing bids from lowestBidIndex.
	•	However, due to the sorting bug, lowestBidIndex is actually pointing to high-priced bids instead of low-priced ones.
	•	As a result, the best-priced bids are removed or significantly reduced, refunding their coupon amounts back to the original bidders.

4. Attacker Secures a Winning Position
	•	After removing higher-priced bids, the remaining bids mostly belong to the attacker, which the contract mistakenly considers “high-priced” due to the bug.
	•	This leaves fewer competitors in the auction, artificially lowering the clearing price.

5. Final Settlement
	•	When the auction ends, the contract finalizes the trade as long as currentCouponAmount >= totalBuyCouponAmount.
	•	The attacker secures the auctioned asset (sellReserveToken) at a much lower cost than they otherwise would have.

### Mitigation

•	Core Fix: Correct the cross-multiplication formula in insertSortedBid, ensuring that (newBuy * currentSell) > (currentBuy * newSell) matches the intended high-to-low sorting order.
	•	Once fixed, lowestBidIndex will correctly point to the lowest-priced bid, and removeExcessBids will remove actual low-price bids instead of high-value ones.
