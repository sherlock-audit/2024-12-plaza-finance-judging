# Attacker can DoS early depositors and render PreDeposit.sol unusable

### Summary

Attacker can DoS early depositors and render PreDeposit.sol unusable by making large deposit up to `reserveCap`, so any other deposits will fail and no one will be able to become early depositor anymore, and withdraw all deposited funds right deposit period ends. 



### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L119-L129)

`PreDeposit.sol` is designed to incentivize early depositors. The issue is that users can deposit any amounts (up to `reserveCap`) and withdraw funds anytime (during deposit period) with zero fees.

```solidity
    if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached();

    address recipient = onBehalfOf == address(0) ? msg.sender : onBehalfOf;

    // if user would like to put more than available in cap, fill the rest up to cap and add that to reserves
    if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
      amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
    }

    balances[recipient] += amount;
    reserveAmount += amount;
```

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Balance of PreDeposit = 0, reserve cap = 100e18;
2. Amelie deposits 100e18 reserve tokens to a PreDeposit at the `depositStartTime`;
3. Other users are trying to become early depositors, but reserve cap already reached;
4. Amelie withdraws 100e18 reserve tokens right before deposit period ends.


### Impact

Attacker can DoS early depositors and render PreDeposit.sol unusable.


### PoC

### Mitigation

It's recommended to add withdrawal fee and max deposit amount per address.
