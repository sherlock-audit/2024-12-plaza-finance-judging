# Pool Contract: Comparison Between Different Decimals

### Summary

`Pool::getRedeemAmount` calculates the amount of reserve tokens to be redeemed for a given amount of bond or leverage tokens.

It is expected that when the market price (`marketRate`) is lower than the calculated `redeemRate`, the `marketRate` is used as the reference price for redemption. However, the issue arises because these rates are represented with different decimal precision.

For example:
redeemRate is represented with 6 decimals, whereas marketRate is passed as an argument with a precision determined by the oracle.

```solidity
    uint8 oracleDecimals = getOracleDecimals(reserveToken, USD);

    uint256 marketRate;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(address(bondToken), USD);
    if (feed != address(0)) {
      marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD)
        .normalizeAmount(
          getOracleDecimals(address(bondToken), USD), 
          oracleDecimals // this is the decimals of the reserve token chainlink feed
        );
    }
```

Here, marketRate has oracleDecimals precision, which may not be compatible with the expected 6 decimals of redeemRate.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Since `marketRate` typically has more decimals than `redeemRate`, it will almost always appear greater. This effectively neutralizes the option to consider the market price when performing a redemption.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Standardize the decimals of both rates to ensure compatibility.
