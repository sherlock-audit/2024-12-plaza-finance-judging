# Uniform Market Rate Restriction Risks Limiting Leveraged Token Excess Gains and Bond Token Priority in Redemption

### Summary

The implementation of market rate restrictions applies uniformly to both bond tokens and leveraged tokens, potentially causing leveraged tokens to lose their excess returns during market surges. This behavior diverges from the expected design as described in the [whitepaper](https://docs.plaza.finance/protocol-mechanics/redeem-sell), which does not apply market rate restrictions to leveraged tokens with under excess returns.

Furthermore, when the collateral level is insufficient (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD), both token types use the formula tvl * multiplier / assetSupply, but with different multiplier. However, both token use the same market rate without different multiplier if market rate < both redeem rate, which may bond holder loss their priority in redemption and introduce potential arbitrage opportunities.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the uniform application of the market rate restriction to all token types, regardless of their intended financial characteristics:

    if (feed != address(0)) {
      marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD)
        .normalizeAmount(
          getOracleDecimals(address(bondToken), USD), 
          oracleDecimals // this is the decimals of the reserve token chainlink feed
        );
    }

```

    TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 bondSupply,
    uint256 levSupply,
    uint256 poolReserves,
    uint256 ethPrice,
    uint8 oracleDecimals,
    uint256 marketRate
  ) public pure returns(uint256) {
...

    // Calculate the redeem rate based on the collateral level and token type
    uint256 redeemRate;
    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
    } else {
      redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
    }

// @audit the uniform application of the market rate restriction to all token types, regardless of excess return and token multiplier
if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
    redeemRate = marketRate;
}
...
```
This design does not distinguish between the fixed-income nature of bond tokens and the floating-return nature of leveraged tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Bull Market: A market rate mechanism exists and enforces a cap on the redeem rate. The protocol calculates redeem rates using the total value locked (TVL) and asset supplies. Leveraged token redeem rates often exceed the market rate during favorable market conditions.
2. Bear Market: Bond tokens are low-risk assets, intended to have priority in redemption. Leverage tokens are high-risk assets, designed to absorb higher losses. However, the current logic does not reflect these distinctions effectively.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Leveraged tokens holders lose their excess return when the protocol's TVL is increasing due to rising asset prices or favorable conditions.
2. Bond tokens holders lose their priority in redemption when the collateral level is insufficient (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD)

### Attack Path

1.Bull Market
- It identifies a scenario where the bond token market price is lower than Leveraged token with excess return.
- Users purchase leveraged tokens at bull market price.
- They are expected to have excess return in bull market.
- Depending on the protocol’s rules, the user redeems the Leveraged tokens for their capped redeem rate(market rate), potentially lower than the excess return.

2.Bear Market
- It identifies a scenario where the bond token market price is lower than both redeem rate of bond and Leveraged tokens.
- Users purchase bond tokens at bear market price.
- They are expected to have priority redemption in bear market.
- Depending on the protocol’s rules, the user redeems the bond tokens  as same as leveraged token holders, losing their priority in redemption.

### Impact

1. **Economic Inefficiency:** Leveraged tokens lose their expected excess returns, reducing their attractiveness to investors. Bond tokens holders lose their priority in redemption when the collateral level is insufficient.
2. **Protocol Instability:** Uncontrolled redemptions or conversions may lead to liquidity stress or depletion of reserves, especially during volatile market conditions.


### PoC

**Scenario 1 :**
- TVL = 20000 ETH
- Bond token supply = 1000
- Leveraged token supply = 1000
- Bond token market price = 0.9 ETH

**Expected Redeem Rates:**
- Bond tokens (capped): 0.9 ETH
- Leveraged tokens: (20000 - 1000) / 1000 = 19 ETH

**Redeem by Market Rates:**
- Bond tokens (capped): 0.9 ETH
- Leveraged tokens: 0.9 ETH
Loss: 19 - 0.9 = 18.1 ETH

**Scenario 2 :**
- TVL = 1000 ETH
- Bond token supply = 1000 
- Leveraged token supply = 1000
- Bond token multiplier = 0.8
- Leveraged token multiplier = 0.2
- Bond token market price = 0.1 ETH

**Expected Redeem Rates:**
- Bond tokens (capped): (1000 * 0.8) / 1000 = 0.8
- Leveraged tokens: (1000 * 0.2) / 1000 = 0.2 

**Redeem by Market Rates**: 
- Bond tokens (capped): 0.1 ETH
- Leveraged tokens: 0.1 ETH
- loss: Bond tokens lose priority in redemption


### Mitigation

To address the identified issue, the protocol should distinguish between bond and leveraged tokens in its market rate restriction logic.
