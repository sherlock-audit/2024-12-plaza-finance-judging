# In the joinBalancerAndPredeposit() function, the remaining Balancer Pool Tokens are not returned to the user.



## Summary

In the joinBalancerAndPredeposit() function, the remaining Balancer Pool Tokens are not returned to the user.
## Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L23
```javascript
    function joinBalancerAndPredeposit(
        bytes32 balancerPoolId,
        address _predeposit,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        // Step 1: Join Balancer Pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = joinBalancerPool(balancerPoolId, assets, maxAmountsIn, userData);

        // Step 2: Approve balancerPoolToken for PreDeposit
        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(_predeposit, balancerPoolTokenReceived);

        // Step 3: Deposit to PreDeposit
@>        PreDeposit(_predeposit).deposit(balancerPoolTokenReceived, msg.sender);

        return balancerPoolTokenReceived;
    }

```

```javascript
function _deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) private checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
    if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached();

    address recipient = onBehalfOf == address(0) ? msg.sender : onBehalfOf;

    // if user would like to put more than available in cap, fill the rest up to cap and add that to reserves
    if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
@>      amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
    }

    balances[recipient] += amount;
    reserveAmount += amount;

    IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    emit Deposited(recipient, amount);
  }
```
The user obtains a certain amount of Balancer Pool Tokens, denoted as balancerPoolTokenReceived, through the joinBalancerPool() function. However, in the PreDeposit contract, there is a reserveCap limit. When the addition of balancerPoolTokenReceived exceeds the reserveCap, the actual deposited amount becomes smaller than balancerPoolTokenReceived. The unused portion of the Balancer Pool Tokens is not returned to the user.


## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions
When reserveAmount + balancerPoolTokenReceived exceeds reserveCap, the actual deposit amount is less than balancerPoolTokenReceived. The unused portion of the Balancer Pool Tokens is not refunded to the user.

## Attack Path


## Impact
The user loses Balancer Pool Tokens.

## PoC

## Mitigation
The _deposit() function returns the actually used amount, then subtracts this value from balancerPoolTokenReceived to calculate the amount that should be refunded to the user.
