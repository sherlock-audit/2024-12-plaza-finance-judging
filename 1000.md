# Missing L2 Sequencer Uptime Check in Chainlink Price Fetching

### Summary

The getOraclePrice() function in OracleReader.sol fetches asset prices from Chainlink oracles but does not verify the uptime status of the L2 sequencer. Chainlink recommends checking the L2 sequencer’s uptime and waiting for a grace period after it comes back online before relying on the price feeds. Failing to follow this recommendation can result in using outdated or incorrect prices, potentially leading to inaccurate calculations within the protocol.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L70

In OracleReader.sol::getOraclePrice(), the code retrieves the price from the Chainlink feed:

```javascript
function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns (uint256) {
    .
    .
    .
    (, int256 answer,, uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
    .
    .
    .
}
```

The function does not include logic to:
	1.	Query the L2 sequencer’s uptime status.
	2.	Enforce a grace period before accepting the price after a sequencer outage, as recommended by Chainlink.

### Internal Pre-conditions

L2 sequencer uptime data is available from Chainlink’s L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed

### External Pre-conditions

An L2 sequencer experiences downtime, temporarily halting accurate price updates.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Without verifying the L2 sequencer’s uptime and enforcing a grace period:
	•	The protocol may accept outdated or incorrect prices.
	•	This can lead to miscalculations in asset valuations, potentially harming users and affecting protocol stability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

	Integrate Chainlink’s L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed to check for sequencer downtime:
