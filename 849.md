# preDepositor is able to get all bonds and leverage tokens almost for free

### Summary

preDeposits created for early distribution of bonds and leverages tokens. It distributes them depends of a part of ETH predepositors send to a contract.
Users is able to deposit/withdraw funds while period is active
The distribution looks like this: PreDeposit.sol claim()
```solidity
    uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
    uint256 userLeverageShare = (leverageAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
```
Meanwhile there is cap for ETH protocol is willing to receive while this stage

1)The user will enter as earlier as possible and deposit amount of ETH up to reserveCap
2)Right before end of predeposit period user will withdraw almost all his funds leaving some dust
3)Now user will get all bonds/leverage tokens almost for free since reserveAmount var hold very low amount after withdraw

### Root Cause

PreDeposit.sol claim()
```solidity
    uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
    uint256 userLeverageShare = (leverageAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
```
PreDeposit.sol withdraw()

### Attack Path

1)The user will enter as earlier as possible and deposit amount of ETH up to reserveCap
2)Right before end of predeposit period user will withdraw almost all his funds leaving some dust
3)Now user will get all bonds/leverage tokens almost for free since reserveAmount var hold very low amount after withdraw

### Impact

lost funds for protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add buffer period before end of predeposit in which users won't be able to withdraw
