# Incorrect Fee Calculation After a Zero-Fee Period

### Summary

The [`Pool::setFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L674) function has a bug where it doesn't correctly calculate fees after a zero-fee period. Specifically, it fails to update the `lastFeeClaimTime` when transitioning from no fees to a fee. This leads to incorrect fee charges because the system starts calculating fees from before the fee change.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is the logic in `Pool::setFee`, which does not update the `lastFeeClaimTime` when transitioning from a zero fee to a non-zero fee. The [`getFeeAmount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L680) function returns zero during the zero-fee period, which prevents `lastFeeClaimTime` from being updated. As a result, the subsequent `Pool::claimFees` calculation incorrectly includes the time period during which fees were set to zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol has set fees to zeros (for promotional or other purpose)
2. The `Pool::setFee` function is called to transition from a zero fee to a non-zero fee.

### Attack Path

1. A zero-fee period is initiated, setting `lastFeeClaimTime` to a current timestamp.
2. Governance transitions to a non-zero fee by calling `Pool::setFee` with a positive `_fee` value.
3. The `getFeeAmount()` function evaluates to zero, preventing `lastFeeClaimTime` from being updated.
4. The `Pool::claimFees` function is called, which calculates fees for the period from the outdated `lastFeeClaimTime` to the current block timestamp.
5. Fees are incorrectly applied to the zero-fee period, resulting in unintended accrual or miscalculation of fees.

### Impact

Overcharging users for periods when no fees were intended to be applied. Impact depends on the duration of the zero-fee period and amount of reserve token in the pool.

### PoC

`lastFeeClaimTime` is only updated in the `Pool::claimFees` function when the fee amount is greater than zero.

```solidity
function setFee(uint256 _fee) external onlyRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE()) {
	// Fee cannot exceed 10%
	require(_fee <= 100000, FeeTooHigh());

	// Force a fee claim to prevent governance from setting a higher fee
	// and collecting increased fees on old deposits
@>      if (getFeeAmount() > 0) {
	  claimFees();
	}

	uint256 oldFee = fee;
	fee = _fee;
	emit FeeChanged(oldFee, _fee);
}
```

### Mitigation

The `Pool::setFee` function needs to update `lastFeeClaimTime` when the old fee was zero:

```diff
function setFee(uint256 _fee) external onlyRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE()) {
  // Fee cannot exceed 10%
  require(_fee <= 100000, FeeTooHigh());
  
  // Force a fee claim to prevent governance from setting a higher fee
  // and collecting increased fees on old deposits
  if (getFeeAmount() > 0) {
    claimFees();
  }
  
+ if (fee = 0) {
+   lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
+ }
  
  uint256 oldFee = fee;
  fee = _fee;
  emit FeeChanged(oldFee, _fee);
}
```
