# By splitting large purchases and redemptions into multiple smaller amounts, users can get more returns.

## Summary

The functions `getCreateAmount` and `getRedeemAmount` are used to calculate the amount a user can get each time they purchase or redeem. However, once collateralLevel exceeds COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD, the user's profit from multiple small transactions will be significantly higher than one large transaction. There was a similar valid issue in the past: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update-judging/issues/34

## Vulnerability Details

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L306-L344

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L477-L525

In the function `getCreateAmount`, once collateralLevel exceeds COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD, the creationRate (i.e., purchase price of BOND_TOKEN) is calculated using:

```solidity
    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }
      creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;
    }
```

Here, `tvl / assetSupply` is equal to collateralLevel (ignore the decimals). Therefore, as BOND_TOKEN is purchased continuously, its price will gradually decrease. In other words, users can obtain more BOND_TOKEN by dividing a purchase into multiple smaller purchases.

The same problem also occurs in the function `getRedeemAmount`.

```solidity
    // Calculate the redeem rate based on the collateral level and token type
    uint256 redeemRate;
    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply); 
    }
```

When BOND_TOKEN is continuously redeemed, the value of collateralLevel will continue to rise, and marketRate will also rise. Therefore, users can obtain more ETH by dividing a redemption into multiple smaller redemptions.

## Impact

Users can get more returns by dividing a large purchase or redemption into multiple smaller amounts,.

### Mitigation

Middle value should be used instead of end value.
