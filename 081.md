# Inaccurate Calculation of User Shares Based on Historical Balances

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L190C3-L199C4

The BonToken contract incorrectly assumes that a user's balance remains constant across periods when calculating shares. It uses the user's current balance to calculate shares for all periods since the last update, failing to account for any transfers or balance changes that occurred during those periods.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L190C3-L199C4

function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
        shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
}

The getIndexedUserAmount function uses the user's current balance to calculate shares for each period since userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod.
This means that any changes in the user's balance during those periods are ignored.
The calculation inaccurately applies the current balance to past periods, leading to incorrect share accrual.

Example:

Alice holds 100 tokens at Period 0.
userAssets[Alice].lastUpdatedPeriod is 0.
globalPool.currentPeriod is 1.

Period Advancement:
The period advances to Period 1.
sharesPerToken is updated for Period 1.

Token Transfer:
Alice transfers 50 tokens to Bob during Period 1.
After the transfer:
Alice's balance is 50 tokens.
Bob's balance is 50 tokens.

Update of User Assets on Transfer:
_update function is called, which in turn calls updateIndexedUserAssets for Alice and Bob.
For Alice:
getIndexedUserAmount calculates shares using her current balance of 50 tokens for Period 0 to Period 1.
This incorrectly assumes she had 50 tokens during Period 0, whereas she actually had 100 tokens.

For Bob:
getIndexedUserAmount calculates shares using his current balance of 50 tokens for Period 0 to Period 1.
Bob didn't hold any tokens during Period 0, so he shouldn't accrue any shares for that period.

Alice receives fewer shares than she should have because the calculation underestimates her holdings during Period 0.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users do not receive the correct amount of shares corresponding to their actual token holdings during each period.
Early token holders will be disadvantaged as their shares are under-calculated.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Adjust users' indexedAmountShares immediately during transfers to reflect the movement of tokens.
