# Predictable bond token address allows an attacker to prevent the Bond market rate check mechanism from being used in the protocol

### Summary

The predictable nature of Bond Token addresses due to their deployment process, together to the current protocol design, allows attackers to deploy Aerodrome pools with incorrect initial `sqrtPriceX96`, forcing Bond price to always be huge, and DoS’ing the market rate check functionality.

### Root Cause

Bond tokens are [deployed via CREATE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/ab5bbd7d54042e4444b711a32def5b639fbd63b4/plaza-evm/src/utils/Deployer.sol#L22) when a pool is deployed in the factory by interacting with the `Deployer` contract:

```solidity
 // File: PoolFactory.sol
 
 function createPool( 
    PoolParams calldata params,
    uint256 reserveAmount,
    uint256 bondAmount,
    uint256 leverageAmount,
    string memory bondName,
    string memory bondSymbol,
    string memory leverageName,
    string memory leverageSymbol,
    bool pauseOnCreation
  ) external whenNotPaused() onlyRole(POOL_ROLE) returns (address) {

    ...
    
    // Deploy Bond token
    BondToken bondToken = BondToken(deployer.deployBondToken( 
      bondBeacon,
      bondName,
      bondSymbol,
      address(this), // minter
      address(this), // governance
      address(this), // poolFactory
      params.sharesPerToken
    ));
    
    ...
 }
```

`deployBondToken` is actually permissionless:

```solidity
// File: Deployer.sol

function deployBondToken(
    address bondBeacon,
    string memory name,
    string memory symbol,
    address minter,
    address governance,
    address poolFactory,
    uint256 sharesPerToken
  ) external returns(address) {
    return address(new BeaconProxy(
      address(bondBeacon),
      abi.encodeCall(
        BondToken.initialize, (name, symbol, minter, governance, poolFactory, sharesPerToken)
      )
    ));
  }
```

Because of this and [how CREATE works](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/cli/2.8/deploying-with-create2#create), the address of the bond token to be deployed **can’t be known until the token has actually been deployed.** This allows an attacker to actually predict the exact Bond token address by controlling the `Deployer`'s nonce. The attacker can then create all the possible pools in Aerodrome and initialize them with an extreme `sqrtPriceX96`, making the Bond Token price be extremely low.

### Attack Path

1. The deposit period in `PreDeposit` has ended. The plaza finance team is monitoring the pools and believes that the Bond token will be deployed at address 0xaa… due to the current `Deployer` contract nonce. They have already created an Aerodrome pool for bond token 0xaa… , which is expected to be used as the oracle for bond token.
2. Because the `PreDeposit`'s `createPool` function is permissionless, the attacker calls it to create the Plaza pool. Prior to this, and outside the pool creation flow, the attacker calls the `Deployer`'s `deployBondToken` function to increase the `Deployer`'s nonce.  The bond token with address 0xaa… is deployed, but **this is not the one that will be set in the pool, as this was deployed outside of the `createPool` execution.** Inside the `createPool` flow, the bond token is deployed, but its address is actually 0xbb… . Note that this address **can be known by the attacker as he is the one triggering the attack.**
3. After deploying the token (or not necessarily after, as the attacker knew the actual Bond token address prior to steps 1 and 2), the attacker creates Aerodrome pools for all possible fee tiers, and initializes the pools with an extreme initial `sqrtPriceX96` , making bond tokens extremely cheap. This is possible because Aerodrome pool deployments [are permissionless](https://basescan.org/address/0x5e7BB104d84c7CB9B682AaC2F3d509f5F406809A#code#F1#L67), and an initial arbitrary `sqrtPriceX96` can be set when [initializing the pool](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/main/contracts/core/CLPool.sol#L148):
    
    ```solidity
    // File: CLPool.sol from https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/slipstream/blob/main/contracts/core/CLPool.sol# 
    
    /// @inheritdoc ICLPoolActions
        function initialize(
            address _factory,
            address _token0,
            address _token1,
            int24 _tickSpacing,
            address _factoryRegistry,
            uint160 _sqrtPriceX96
        ) external override {
            ...
    
            int24 tick = TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(_sqrtPriceX96);
    
           ...
    
            slot0 = Slot0({
                sqrtPriceX96: _sqrtPriceX96,
                tick: tick,
                observationIndex: 0,
                observationCardinality: cardinality,
                observationCardinalityNext: cardinalityNext,
                unlocked: true
            });
    
            emit Initialize(_sqrtPriceX96, tick);
        }
    
    ```
    
Setting such an extreme initial `sqrtPriceX96` in all Aerodrome pools for Bond makes it impossible to bring the price in the pools to a reasonable value, as a huge amount of bond tokens will be needed to be swapped in order to change the pool’s price. Such a big amount of bond tokens can’t actually be minted through the Plaza pool, as a huge (unrealistic) amount of deposits would be needed to simply perform a swap or to be provided as liquidity to allow for swaps. 
    
4. This makes the Plaza team uncapable of setting the oracle for the Bond market rate, given that setting it will mean incorrect prices will be reported for Bond Token.

### Impact

The bond market price check in `simulateRedeem` will be prevented, given that the Plaza team will be forced to not set the oracle for bond as it will misreport prices, effectively breaking the core mechanism to compute redemption prices [described in the documentation](https://docs.plaza.finance/protocol-mechanics/redeem-sell#redemption-of-bondeth):

> *If Estimated Pro-Forma Collateral Level > 1.2: Redemption Price is the lesser of 100 USDC or current market price of bondETH*
> 

> *If Estimated Pro-Forma Collateral Level ≤ 1.2: Redemption Price adjusts to 80% of vault's collateral value per bondETH or market price, whichever is lower*
> 

This is a critical feature for bond price derivation, as it aims to disincentivize arbitrage through redemption, effectively preventing bad arbitrage (for example, preventing users from buying bond in a DEX at $95 and redeeming it in Plaza at $100). Not having this feature means users can always extract value from the protocol when prices reported in the DeX are lower. In addition, there's no workaround for this issue if `PreDeposit` is used. Because of this, the issue should be deemed high severity, given that  the difference between the computed redeem rate and the actual market rate will always be lost, leading to a loss of funds without big external limitations.

A side effect is the attacker can force the system to use a pool with a specific fee, instead of the fee desired by the protocol

### Mitigation

Use Create2 to derive the bond token address, and create the Aerodrome pools prior to deploying the token on pool creation.
