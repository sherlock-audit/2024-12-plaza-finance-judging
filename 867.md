# The fee is double charged on every `create` or `redeem`

### Summary

When creating or redeeming tokens, an assets under management fee is applied. However that fee is also applied, to the fees that has already been charged. 

### Root Cause

When creating tokens, to accurately calculate the price a fee is deducted from the `poolReserves` ([ref](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273)). The fee is a function of the pool's current reserve token balance and the time passed since the last fee claim. However, the fee is not permanently deducted from the pool's reserve balance. So on the next creation of tokens, the next fee will be applied to the pool's current balance, which contains the previous fee amount. Thus, resulting in double charging and reducing the actual pool's reserve balance more than it should.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `create()`
2. The fee is charged on assets under management
3. After some time another user calls `create()`
4. The fee is charged on the assets under management and the previous fee. 

### Impact

The inaccurate fee calculation will lead to reduced total value, which will lower the creation and redeem rates. The protocol will suffer loses when users are buying and the users will suffer loses when redeeming.

### PoC

The current PoC follows the logic for pool's reserve token balance calculation in [simulateCreate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L262)

Initially `poolReserves` = 100 ether, the `fee` will be 10%.
1. User calls `create()` and provides 50 ether.
2. The difference between the `lastFeeClaimTime` and `block.timestamp` is 3600 sec (1 hour). The fee will be `100 * 3600 * 0.1 / 365 * 24 * 3600 =  3600 / 31536000 = 0.001141553 ether`
3. After the token creation the new value of `poolReserves` will be 150 ether.
4. After one more hour User2 calls `create()` and provides 50 ether.
5. The difference between the `lastFeeClaimTime` and `block.timestamp` is 7200 sec (2 hours).
The fee will be `150 * 7200 * 0.1 / 365 *24 *3600 = 108000 / 31536000 = 0.003424658 ether.
If we deduct the fee from the first transaction the `poolReserves` should be 149.99885847.
And the fee should be `149.99885847 * 7200 * 0.1 / 365 * 24 * 3600 = 0.00342631 ether

The difference is `0.000000027 ether`.

This value might seem small now, but keep in mind that this value is for only 100 ether in the pool and 2 transactions of 50 ether for 2 hours. The longer the time between fee claims, and the bigger the pool's balance is, the bigger the difference will be.

### Mitigation

Once the fee is charged, subtract it from the pool's reserve token balance, so it is not charged twice.
