# Blocklisted bidder cannot be removed from auction even his bid == lowestBidIndex and his can make auction always fail

### Summary

The coupon token used in the auction is `USDC` which has a feature to blacklist certain addresses. When the bidder's address is blacklisted after making a bid, the bid he has cannot be removed even though it is the `lowestBidIndex`. This is because when the `lowestBidIndex` is removed in the `_removeBid()` function, the coupon token (USDC) as much as the initial bid (`sellCouponAmount`) will be sent back directly to the bidder's address where the address has been blacklisted and of course the transfer will fail.

Blacklisted bidders can also cause auctions to always fail. This happens when the removeExcessBids() process is performed. This needs to be done to keep currentCouponAmount = totalBuyCouponAmount. If currentCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount then the auction will fail due to a pool_sale_limit error.

### Root Cause

*In [Auction.sol:325](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L325) directly transfer coupon token to bidder*
