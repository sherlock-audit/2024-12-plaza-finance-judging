# `sharesPerToken` still gets snapshotted even if the respective auction failed to sell off the reserve tokens

### Summary

When an auction is started the [Pool::startAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L552-L567) contract deploys and auction and calls [BondToken::increaseIndexedAssetPeriod](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L217-L229), which increases the period.

```solidity
    function increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(uint256 sharesPerToken) public onlyRole(DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
        globalPool.previousPoolAmounts.push(
            PoolAmount({
                period: globalPool.currentPeriod,
                amount: totalSupply(),
                sharesPerToken: globalPool.sharesPerToken
            })
        );
        globalPool.currentPeriod++;
        globalPool.sharesPerToken = sharesPerToken;

        emit IncreasedAssetPeriod(globalPool.currentPeriod, sharesPerToken);
    }
```

Once a period is increased the `sharesPerToken` for it is saved (and cannot be changed) and will be added to `previousPoolAmounts` at the start of the next one.

After the auction period the auction has 3 states:
- `FAILED_UNDERSOLD` and `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` which allows the user to refund their coupon tokens
- `SUCCEEDED` which allows the users to claim the reserve tokens emitted by the pool.

However, the codebase does not handle the cases where the auction was unable to acumulate the needed coupon amount and still checkpoints the shares for the users.

After the distribution period anyone can call `Pool::startAuction` and roll over to the next period, which will incorrectly account shares for all of the holders for the auction that did not distribute any coupon tokens

### Root Cause

The codebase is missing a crucial check to validate whether the auction actually distributed the tokens. Which might cause users

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The auction fails either due to not accumulating enough coupon tokens or selling over the pool limit

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. There is a total supply of 1000 bond tokens
2. sharesPerToken is 2.5
3. Period 1 - 2.5 USDC shares per token -> Auction passed (2,500 USDC send to distributor)
4. Every user claimed (not needed for the vulnerabily, but for simplicity)
5. Period 2 - 2.5 USDC shares per token -> Auction undersold so it failed
6. After the distribution Alice called `startAuction` and started the new period (the shares for period 2 are already saved with no way of being changed) which starts  period 3
7. Period 3's auction  passed  and 2,500 USDC are sent to distributor and period 4 is started checkpointing the shares for period 3
8. Every user holding from period one is able to claim 2x that what he is owed, due to having shares from period 2

### Impact

After every failed auction every holder during that auction still has accounted new shares even if the auction did not distribute anything claiming more rewards than they are entitled to.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a function in `BondToken`, to be called to reset the periods `sharesPerToken` after a failed auction.
