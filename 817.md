# Auction initialize() Permits Same-Token Auctions Due to Missing Token/Caller Validation Breaking Core LST/USDC Exchange Mechanism

## Summary
The Auction contract's `initialize()` function lacks both token validation and access control, allowing the contract to be deployed with identical tokens for `buyCouponToken` and `sellReserveToken` by any caller. Since the contract's sole purpose is facilitating the sale of ETH LSTs/LRTs to generate USDC for bondETH coupon payments, allowing the same token for bidding and rewards fundamentally breaks this exchange mechanism.

```solidity
function initialize(
  address _buyCouponToken, 
  address _sellReserveToken,
  ...
) initializer public {
  buyCouponToken = _buyCouponToken;
  sellReserveToken = _sellReserveToken;
  pool = msg.sender;
  if (_beneficiary == address(0)) {
    beneficiary = msg.sender;
  }
  ...
}
```

While the Auction contract is designed to be deployed by the Pool contract as part of Plaza's coupon payment system, there is nothing preventing malicious actors from:

1. Deploying their own instance of the Auction contract
2. Initializing it with the same token for both `buyCouponToken` and `sellReserveToken`
3. Becoming both `pool` and `beneficiary` since `msg.sender` is assigned to these roles
4. Creating auctions that serve no economic purpose since bids and rewards use the same token

This could be used to:
- Create "fake" auctions that appear legitimate but don't actually exchange LSTs/LRTs for USDC
- Confuse users who may participate in these invalid auctions thinking they are part of the Plaza protocol
- Potentially manipulate token prices through wash trading if the same token is used for bids and rewards

## Impact
The severity is high because the unrestricted initialization allows anyone to deploy malicious Auction contracts that subvert Plaza's core mechanism of selling ETH LSTs/LRTs to generate USDC for bondETH coupon payments. By initializing with identical tokens, an attacker could create auctions that appear to be legitimate Plaza protocol auctions but fail to actually exchange tokens as required for the coupon system. Since the auction and bid interfaces would still function normally (just with the same token), users could unknowingly participate in these non-functional auctions, losing gas and time while failing to achieve the intended token exchange. This is particularly concerning as Plaza's documentation emphasizes the importance of auctions for generating bondETH coupon payments, making invalid auctions a direct threat to a core protocol function.

## Recommended mitigation steps
Add both token validation and access control to `initialize()`:

```solidity
error NotPoolFactory();
error SameTokenNotAllowed();
error ZeroAddress();

function initialize(
    address _buyCouponToken,
    address _sellReserveToken,
    ...
) initializer public {
    // Add access control
    if (msg.sender != poolFactory) revert NotPoolFactory();
    
    // Add token validation
    if (_buyCouponToken == _sellReserveToken) revert SameTokenNotAllowed();
    
    buyCouponToken = _buyCouponToken;
    sellReserveToken = _sellReserveToken;
    pool = msg.sender;
    ...
}
```
