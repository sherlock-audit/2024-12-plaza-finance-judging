# User's claimable reserve tokens can get stuck due to use of raw transfer() inside claimBid()

## Description
[claimBid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L362) uses `transfer()` instead of `safeTransfer()`:
```js
      function claimBid(uint256 bidIndex) auctionExpired auctionSucceeded whenNotPaused external {
        Bid storage bidInfo = bids[bidIndex];
        if (bidInfo.bidder != msg.sender) revert NothingToClaim();
        if (bidInfo.claimed) revert AlreadyClaimed();

        bidInfo.claimed = true;
@--->   IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);

        emit BidClaimed(bidIndex, bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
      }
```

Raw `transfer()` can silently fail and there is no check implemented to verify the successful transfer. If it fails then:
- The bid would be marked as `claimed = true`
- The user would not receive their tokens
- The user cannot try to claim again because the call will revert with `AlreadyClaimed()`

## Impact
- The tokens remain locked in the Auction contract
- Neither the user nor the protocol can recover these tokens on user's behalf

## Mitigation 
Use `safeTransfer()` instead, as has been done in other functions.
