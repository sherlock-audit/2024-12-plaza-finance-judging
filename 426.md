# Malicius user can block users from bidding in an auction when `maxBid` is exceeded

### Summary

When a user tries to bid in ongoing auction and `maxBids` is exceeded the `_removeBid()` function will be called with `lowestBidIndex` send. The issue is that when removing the lowest bid, the collateral of the owner of the bid is being pushed to him by `safeTransfer()` being called instead of adding it to a mapping and allowing the owner of the bid to withdraw it. The receiver can be a malicous contract and revert on receive blocking the `bid()` function.

### Root Cause

In [Auction::_removeBid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L324C5-L325C67) Pushing the collateral to the owner of the `lowestIndex` when removing the bid can trigger revert on receive if the receiver address is malicious contract.

```solidity
    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. maxBids must be exceeded

### External Pre-conditions

1. The owner address of `lowestBidIndex` must be a malicious contract which will revert on receive of tokens 

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates a contract which will revert on receive of tokens
2. Places a bid with minimum USDC required.
3. `bidCount > maxBids`  check is done 
4. `_removeBid(lowestBidIndex)` will be called and will try to send back the collateral to the attacker contract which will revert
5. The bid will revert as well.

### Impact

One of the main invariants will be broken, which is allowing to bid when `bidCount > maxBids` by removing the `lowestBidIndex` and allowing higher bids to be placed. After the attacker uses his malicious contract to place the `lowestBid` , then with his main account he can place multiple bids, depending of his balance he can even fulfil the max slots of possible bids placed by biding till `maxBids` value is met and steal the whole amount of `totalSellReserveAmount` tokens for him.

### PoC

1. An auctions just starts with `totalBuyCouponAmount` set to `100 000 USDC .` The `reserveAmount` (ETH) is set to be 95% of the pool balance
2. Alice creates a malicious contract ,which will revert on receive, and takes a place in an auction which just started by placing a minimum bid amount of `sellCouponAmount` tokens which is 100 USDC
3. Then from other account she places a bid with 99 900 USDC tokens and will fulfill all available biding slots
4. Bob tries to bid with 1000 USDC 
5. `_removeBid` is called inside `bid()` function, which will try to remove the current `lowestBid` which is Alice malicius contract and send back her collateral, and then Bob will have to take the place of the `lowestBid` 
6. The `safeTransfer` function will revert and Bob bid will revert as well.

### Mitigation

In `_removeBid` use pull-over-push pattern.
