# A hardcoded `spacing` array in the `getPool` function will cause pool lookup failure as the contract will fail to find valid pools with unsupported or custom tick spacings

**Root Cause:**  
In the [getPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L120-L138) function, If none of the `spacing` values result in a valid pool, the function reverts with `NoPoolFound`. This is problematic because it doesn't handle scenarios where a pool exists but the `spacing` array is incomplete or doesn't include the correct tick spacing for a valid pool. This leads to non-recoverable failures even when a valid pool is present.

---

**Internal Pre-conditions:**  
1. The `spacing` array must not include the tick spacing of an existing valid pool.  

---

**External Pre-conditions:**  
1. The DEX factory (`dexFactory`) must include a pool with a tick spacing not listed in the hardcoded `spacing` array.  

---

**Attack Path:**  
1. A user deploys the contract with a `dexFactory` containing a pool that uses an unsupported tick spacing.  
2. The `initialize` function calls `getPool` to find the pool.  
3. The contract iterates over the hardcoded `spacing` values and fails to find the pool.  
4. The contract reverts with `NoPoolFound`, making the oracle unusable.  

---

**Impact:**  
If none of the spacing values result in a valid pool, users are unable to initialize the oracle or retrieve price data, rendering the contract non-functional despite the existence of a valid pool.

---

**Mitigation:**  
Replace the hardcoded `spacing` array with a dynamic mechanism to retrieve supported tick spacings from the `dexFactory` or allow external configuration of tick spacings.
