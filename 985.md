# Wrong implementation of the `Pool::NotInAuction`

## Summary
The `NotInAuction` modifier does not work as it should because the `auctions[currentPeriod]` will always be the `address(0)`. This because every time a new auction starts the `currentPeriod` gets `+1`.

## Root Cause
The `NotInAuction` modifier checks something that it will be always verified being in this way useless. Every time an auction is created the `BondToken::increaseIndexedAssetPeriod` function increases the `currentPeriod`. Therefore, the condition `require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0)` is always verified whatever it is the `currentPeriod` considered.

## Internal Pre-conditions
An auction is created.

## External Pre-conditions
None.

## Attack Path
Parameters like `AuctionPeriod`, `DistributionPeriod`, `SharesPerToken`, are changed relying on the `NotInAuction` which however does not work as it should allowing all the parameters to be changed when they should be not. 

## Impact
Although `GOV_ROLE` role is trusted (trust inputs), it will rely on the `NotInAuction` modifier (otherwise no need to even write it) when changing some parameters using the functions called: `setSharesPerToken`, `setAuctionPeriod`, `setDistributionPeriod`.   
Any change made on these parameters during an ongoing auction could have a huge impact on all the users.

## Mitigation
Depending on what is the exact moment to check, some solutions could be:
```diff
  modifier NotInAuction() {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
-   require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0), AuctionIsOngoing());
+   require (block.timestamp > lastdistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionperiod, AuctionIsOngoing())
    _;
  }
  ```
```diff
  modifier NotInAuction() {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
-   require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0), AuctionIsOngoing());
+   previousPeriod = currentPeriod-1;  
+   require(block.timestamp > auctions[previousPeriod].endTime())
    _;
  }
  ```
