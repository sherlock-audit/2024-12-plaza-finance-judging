# Wrong calculations when coupon token is other than 6 decimals

### Summary

Bond holders will get coupon token per share in the distribution period which is their fix yield on bond tokens and coupon token can be any token as a fix reward for the bond holders.

But in bondToken.sol, `SHARES_DECIMALS` which is decimals of the coupon token is set to 6 as a constant which means if coupon token is not 6 decimal token, the calculations will be wrong.

```solidity
uint8 public constant SHARES_DECIMALS = 6;
``` 

### Root Cause

### Attack Path

If coupon token will be other than 6 decimals then calculation of user share will be wrong because `SHARES_DECIMALS` will always be 6 decimals.

```solidity
function getIndexedUserAmount(
        address user,
        uint256 balance,
        uint256 period
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
        uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

        for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
            shares += (balance *
                globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(
                    SHARES_DECIMALS
                );
        }
        return shares;
    }
```
Therefore, even if coupon token is other than 6 decimal, calculation of share will be .toBaseUnit with 6 decimals.

### Impact

Share calculations will be wrong so it will impact either protocol or bond holder depends upon decimals of coupon token.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Protocol should not hardcode share decimals. They should use the decimals of the coupon token.
