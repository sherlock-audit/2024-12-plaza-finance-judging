# User is able to receive bigger amount shares for previous periods by transefering Bonds between another users

### Summary

Each Bond transfer BondToken.sol _updated() called
```solidity
  function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused() {
    if (from != address(0)) {
      updateIndexedUserAssets(from, balanceOf(from));
    }

    if (to != address(0)) {
      updateIndexedUserAssets(to, balanceOf(to));
    }

    super._update(from, to, amount);
  }
```
 This function keeps track of balance changes while transfer, to do this it call BondToken.sol updateIndexedUserAssets()

```solidity
  function updateIndexedUserAssets(address user, uint256 balance) internal {
    uint256 period = globalPool.currentPeriod;
    uint256 shares = getIndexedUserAmount(user, balance, period);
    
    userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares = shares;
    userAssets[user].lastUpdatedPeriod = period;

    emit UpdatedUserAssets(user, period, shares);
  }
```
To calculate shares of updated balance it's calling BondToken.sol getIndexedUserAmount()

```solidity
  function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }
```
The problem here, is we use newly updated balance to calculate shares for previous periods. Meanwhile, shares(i.e. usdc reward) should be calculated based on user previous periods balance (we calculate usdc to receive from auction based on it). This means, if user will receive from someone some Bonds via transfer call then he will eligible for increased reward for previous periods. In another hand, if he transfer his bond to someone, then his reward for previous periods will decreased.

### Root Cause

BondToken.sol getIndexedUserAmount 

```solidity
  function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  } 
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1)User minting few bonds
2)User wait few periods without claiming usdc
3)User receives big amounts of bonds from someone
4)User claim his rewards for all previous periods based on his new balance

### Impact

protocol could be drained(he receive transfer)/financial lose for bond holder(in case he transfered to someone)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

update shares depends on balances for previous periods
