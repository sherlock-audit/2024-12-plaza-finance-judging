# Price Manipulation Risk in Balancer Price Calculation by the `_calculateFairUintPrice` Function

### Summary

The `BalancerOracleAdapter.sol` contract relies on instantaneous token prices and pool weights from the Balancer pool to calculate a "fair unit price" in the `_calculateFairUintPrice` function. However, this methodology is highly susceptible to price manipulation, particularly through flash loans or large trades that temporarily alter the pool's state. Without implementing slippage protection, weight validation, or a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) mechanism, attackers can manipulate pool prices to their advantage, leading to unfair outcomes for users and potential financial losses.

### Root Cause

The core issue lies in the reliance on instantaneous pool weights and prices for calculating the fair unit price. This calculation does not account for transient changes in pool state caused by large transactions or flash loan attacks, which can significantly skew results. 

**Relevant Code**  
The function `_calculateFairUintPrice` directly uses instantaneous values for prices and weights:  
[plaza-evm/src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol:_calculateFairUintPrice#L129-L140](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol#L129C1-L140C4)
```solidity
function _calculateFairUintPrice(
    uint256[] memory prices,
    uint256[] memory weights,
    uint256 invariant,
    uint256 totalBPTSupply
) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 priceWeightPower = FixedPoint.ONE;
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
        priceWeightPower = priceWeightPower.mulDown(
            prices[i].divDown(weights[i]).powDown(weights[i])
        );
    }
    return invariant.mulDown(priceWeightPower).divDown(totalBPTSupply);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The pool weights and prices are derived from the current state of the Balancer pool.
2. There is no mechanism to verify whether the weights or prices have deviated significantly from historical norms.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attackers can access a large amount of capital through flash loans.
2. Balancer pools allow trading that adjusts the weights and token balances within the pool.
3. Users rely on the fair price calculation for decision-making, without the protection of averaged or validated price data.

### Attack Path

1. **Setup**: The attacker borrows a large amount of capital via a flash loan.  
2. **Price Manipulation**: Using the borrowed capital, the attacker performs a series of large trades in the Balancer pool, temporarily altering token ratios and pool weights.  
3. **Exploit**: During the altered state, the attacker triggers the `_calculateFairUintPrice` function or relies on affected downstream processes. The manipulated prices and weights lead to an incorrect fair unit price calculation.  
4. **Profit**: The attacker exploits the price discrepancy to execute arbitrage or liquidations at a significant profit.  
5. **Reset**: After executing the exploit, the attacker returns the borrowed capital, restoring the pool's state. 

### Impact

1. **User Financial Loss**: Users may receive unfair pricing, leading to substantial financial losses.  
2. **Protocol Reputation Damage**: The lack of protection against price manipulation undermines trust in the protocol.  

### PoC

The following pseudocode demonstrates how an attacker could manipulate pool prices and weights to exploit the `_calculateFairUintPrice` function:  

```solidity
contract AttackerContract {
    function manipulatePrice() external {
        // Step 1: Take out a flash loan
        uint256 flashLoanAmount = 1_000 ether;
        flashLoan.borrow(flashLoanAmount);

        // Step 2: Execute large trades to manipulate pool weights and prices
        balancerPool.swap(tokenA, tokenB, flashLoanAmount);

        // Step 3: Call the latestRoundData function (which will call _calculateFairUintPrice function) or indirectly exploit manipulated prices     
uint256 manipulatedPrice = vulnerableContract.latestRoundData();

        // Step 4: Arbitrage the manipulated price
        executeArbitrage(manipulatedPrice);

        // Step 5: Repay the flash loan
        flashLoan.repay();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to implement a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) oracle to calculate prices over a specific time window. This reduces the impact of short-term price fluctuations. For Example:  
   ```solidity
   function getTWAP() public view returns (uint256) {
       uint256 length = observations.length;
       uint256 timeWeightedPrice = 0;
       uint256 totalTime = 0;

       for (uint256 i = 1; i < length; i++) {
           uint256 timeElapsed = observations[i].timestamp - observations[i - 1].timestamp;
           timeWeightedPrice += observations[i - 1].price * timeElapsed;
           totalTime += timeElapsed;
       }

       return timeWeightedPrice / totalTime;
   }
   ```
