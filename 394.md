# Missing IERC20Receiver implementation - M

### Summary

In the function 'claimBid' tokens are being transfered to a bidder. 

`  function claimBid(uint256 bidIndex) auctionExpired auctionSucceeded whenNotPaused external {
    Bid storage bidInfo = bids[bidIndex];
    if (bidInfo.bidder != msg.sender) revert NothingToClaim();
    if (bidInfo.claimed) revert AlreadyClaimed();
    bidInfo.claimed = true;
    IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
    emit BidClaimed(bidIndex, bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
  }`

exactly in this line 

` IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);`

However, the contract is missing IERC20Receiver implementation and the function 'claimBid' does not check if the receiver is a smart contract, this could lead to tokens getting stuck in the receiver contract if the contract does not have any handling logic implemented.

### PoC

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import {console} from "forge-std/console.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("ExampleToken", "EXT") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}

contract PoC is Script {

  function run() external {
  vm.startBroadcast();
    // Deploy the token and receiver contracts
    MyToken myToken = new MyToken();
    Receiver receiver = new Receiver();

    myToken.approve(address(receiver), type(uint256).max);

    receiver.receiveTokens(address(myToken), 10);

    console.log("transfer successful:", myToken.balanceOf(address(receiver)));

  vm.stopBroadcast();
  }
}

contract Receiver {
  // This contract can receive tokens but has no mechanism to work with them

  // Function to receive tokens
  function receiveTokens(address token, uint256 amount) external {
      IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
  }
}


Now the tokens are stuck in the Receiver contract.

### Impact

Tokens will get stuck in the receiver contract, leading to loss of tokens and causing users being concerned and frustrated.


### Mitigation

Check if receiver is a smart contract, implement the IERC20Receiver implementation in the contract, use safeTransfer
