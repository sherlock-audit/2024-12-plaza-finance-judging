# _calculateFairUintPrice()

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol#L129 
because it directly uses pool.getInvariant() along with token weights and Oracle prices without accounting for Balancer’s internal scaling factor for non-18-decimal tokens. In short:
	•	Balancer scales token balances internally based on their actual decimals, normalizing them to 18 decimals before computing the pool’s invariant.
	•	The value returned by pool.getInvariant() is already scaled.
	•	If all tokens in the pool have 18 decimals, this isn’t a problem (since their scaling factors are simply 1). However, if any token has a different number of decimals, the invariant must be unscaled before multiplying by prices to get the correct result.

The simplified formula for the weighted pool BPT price, as given in Balancer’s documentation, is:

\[
\text{BPT Price} =
\frac{\text{Invariant} / \prod_i \bigl(\text{scalingFactor}_i^{\,w_i}\bigr)}
{\text{BPT Supply}}
\;\times\;
\prod_i
\Bigl(\frac{P_i}{w_i}\Bigr)^{\,w_i}
\]

However, in _calculateFairUintPrice(...), the code omits the scaling factor adjustment:
```solidity 
// Missing step: Invariant should be divided by the product of scaling factors raised to weights
for (uint8 i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    priceWeightPower = priceWeightPower
        .mulDown(prices[i].divDown(weights[i]).powDown(weights[i]));
}

return invariant.mulDown(priceWeightPower).divDown(totalBPTSupply);
``` 
Here, the invariant is used directly without being divided by the product of scalingFactor^weight, meaning it remains artificially inflated. If any token in the pool has a decimal count other than 18, the resulting price will be significantly overestimated, as the invariant is internally scaled up.

How to Fix It
	1.	Retrieve Scaling Factors
In a Balancer Weighted Pool, each token has a scalingFactor, typically computed as 10^(18 - tokenDecimals). The retrieval method may vary across different Balancer contract versions, but it can usually be obtained from the pool or a corresponding utility function.
	2.	Apply “Unscaling” to the invariant Before Multiplying Prices
Before incorporating prices, the invariant should be divided by:

\prod_i (\text{scalingFactor}_i^{\,w_i})

Alternatively, scaling factors could be directly incorporated into the price calculations, but the most standard and intuitive approach is to apply this correction to the invariant, aligning the formula with Balancer’s documentation.
	3.	Ensure weights[i] Are in 18-Decimal Format
The code already uses powDown(weights[i]), and since Balancer’s normalized weights are stored with 18 decimals, this is correct—as long as the powDown function properly supports an 18-decimal exponent (which Balancer’s FixedPoint library is designed to handle).

By incorporating this scaling factor correction, _calculateFairUintPrice will produce accurate pool pricing, even for tokens with different decimal places.
