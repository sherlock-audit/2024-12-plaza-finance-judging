# Incorrect State Transitions in `endAuction()`

## Summary 
The `endAuction()` function within the `Auction.sol` smart contract contains a critical logical flaw that disrupts the intended state transitions of the auction process. Specifically, when an auction fails due to exceeding the pool sale limit (`FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`), the function erroneously transfers `buyCouponToken` to the designated beneficiary. This unintended behavior contradicts the protocol's design, where such transfers should only occur upon a successful auction (`State.SUCCEEDED`). If left unaddressed, this vulnerability allows the beneficiary to unlawfully claim funds during failed auction scenarios, undermining the protocol's integrity and financial correctness.

## Vulnerability Details 

### Detailed Explanations of the Vulnerability
The `endAuction()` function is responsible for concluding the auction based on specific conditions. The function evaluates whether the auction has succeeded or failed by checking:

1. **Undersold Condition (`FAILED_UNDERSOLD`)**: If the total coupon amount (`currentCouponAmount`) is less than the required amount (`totalBuyCouponAmount`), the auction fails.
2. **Pool Sale Limit Condition (`FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`)**: If the total reserve tokens sold (`totalSellReserveAmount`) exceed a predefined percentage of the pool's reserve (`poolSaleLimit`), the auction fails.
3. **Successful Auction (`SUCCEEDED`)**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the auction is deemed successful.

**Flaw in State Transition Logic:**
When the auction fails due to the pool sale limit being reached (`FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`), the function still executes the following line:


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L346


This line transfers all `buyCouponToken` held by the contract to the `beneficiary`, irrespective of the auction's success. According to the protocol's design, such transfers should only occur when the auction succeeds. In failure scenarios, no tokens should be disbursed to the beneficiary to prevent unauthorized fund distribution.

```

**Interpretation:**
The test aimed to verify that the beneficiary does not receive any `buyCouponToken` when the auction fails due to the pool sale limit being exceeded. However, the beneficiary erroneously received `500e18` tokens, confirming the presence of the vulnerability.

### Key Insights Demonstrating the Vulnerability’s Validity
1. **State Mismanagement:** The function fails to conditionally execute the token transfer solely based on the auction's success state. Instead, it indiscriminately transfers tokens regardless of whether the auction succeeded or failed.
2. **Protocol Inconsistency:** The unintended transfer contradicts the protocol's invariants, where fund distribution to the beneficiary should be contingent upon a successful auction outcome.
3. **Economic Exploit Potential:** An attacker or malicious beneficiary could exploit this flaw to extract funds during failed auctions, disrupting the financial balance and trust within the system.
4. **Alignment with Documentation:** The protocol's documentation stipulates that funds should only be disbursed to the beneficiary upon successful auctions. The current implementation deviates from this expected behavior, violating the protocol’s intended financial mechanisms.

## Impact 
The improper state transition in the `endAuction()` function has severe implications:

- **Unauthorized Fund Transfer:** The beneficiary can receive `buyCouponToken` even when the auction fails, leading to potential misuse of funds.
- **Financial Losses:** The protocol's reserves may be depleted unjustly, affecting the overall financial health and sustainability of the platform.
- **Erosion of Trust:** Stakeholders and users may lose confidence in the protocol's security and reliability, hindering adoption and participation.


## 6. Tools Used
**Manual Review and Foundry**

## 7. Recommendation Section
To rectify the identified vulnerability, the `endAuction()` function must be adjusted to ensure that `buyCouponToken` transfers to the beneficiary occur exclusively upon a successful auction (`State.SUCCEEDED`). The recommended modification involves introducing a conditional check before executing the transfer. Below is the proposed fix:

```solidity
function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
        state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
        state = State.SUCCEEDED;
        Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
}
```
