# Inconsistency beetwen MAX_BID_AMOUNT and poolSaleLimit could lead to DOS of auction

### Summary

In Auction.sol bid() we have multiple checks in order to get if bid sufficient 
```solidity
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns(uint256) {
    if (sellCouponAmount == 0 || sellCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (buyReserveAmount == 0) revert BidAmountTooLow(); 
    if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh();
```
Meanwhile this line verify if our ETH to bid is lower then MAX_BID_AMOUNT, which is 1e50.
```solidity
if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh();
``` 
This is constant value and have no relation with poolSaleLimit x reserves.

Consider the case where this inconsistency leads to dos of auction
pool amount = 2 eth.
Now user bid marketEthPrice x (let`s say)  1.5 for 3 eth (since 3 eth > then 1e50 the bid will handled)
Meanwhile, if user bid more usdc value than it cost on dex, the bid will took all slots and win an auction.
But because of this check in Auction.sol endAuction()
```solidity
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
```
The auction will failed and bidder will successfully get his bid back.


### Root Cause

Auction.sol bid() 
```solidity
if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh();
``` 

### Internal Pre-conditions

Attack path become more likely in case if it low amount of ETH in reserves
if amount of reserves x poolSaleLimit > MAX_BID_AMOUNT an attack won't be possible

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1)in case reserves x poolSaleLimit < MAX_BID_AMOUNT an attacker have to bid on ETH amount > reserves x poolSaleLimit with sufficient usdc amount
no lose funds for attacker since he will receive his bid back

### Impact

Dos of auction

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check if reserve to bid is lower than reserves x poolSaleLimit
