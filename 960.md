# Possible drain distribution

### Summary

Transferring bond tokens between addresses may result in drain distribution due to the calculation of coupon amounts depending on the user's balance.

### Root Cause

The [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L549) on the calculation example depends on the user's balance in the `BondToken` smart contract.

The calculation of coupon tokens for claim depends on the user's current balance. Given that the user has the ability to transfer bond tokens between addresses, manipulation in the calculation of the amount for claim is possible. The user can re-transfer bond tokens to another user in order to increase the balance or re-transfer bond tokens to their own second address and receive a larger number of coupons.
