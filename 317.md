# An user can claim higher amount of coupon tokens, via funding additional BONDeths to his own address.

### Summary

The claim function is as follow -
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L78

```js
  function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    BondToken bondToken = Pool(pool).bondToken();
    address couponToken = Pool(pool).couponToken();

    if (address(bondToken) == address(0) || couponToken == address(0)){
      revert UnsupportedPool();
    }

    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
@-> uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

    if (IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < shares) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesBalance();
    }
    
    // check if pool has enough *allocated* shares to distribute
    if (couponAmountToDistribute < shares) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesToDistribute();
    }

    // check if the distributor has enough shares tokens as the amount to distribute
    if (IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < couponAmountToDistribute) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesToDistribute();
    }

    couponAmountToDistribute -= shares;
    bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
    
    emit ClaimedShares(msg.sender, currentPeriod, shares);
  }
```

The user can claim higher coupon amount, even if doesn't hold that much amount of BONDeths for periods.

### Root Cause

relying on actual BONDeth balance of holder, instead of internal accounting.

  ```js
  uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
  ```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Suppose that user has 2 addresses `addressA` and `addressB`, and both have BONDeths.
2. Before hitting `claim()`, the user transfers the BONDeths from `addressA` to `addressB` (being used for claiming coupon tokens).
3. the BONDeth balance of `addressB` is fetched by -
    ```js
    uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    ```
4. In that case `addressB` have higher BONDeths.
5. The user will be able to claim, higher number of coupon tokens, as the shares is directly proportion to BONDeth balance of user.
    ```js
    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }
    ```
6. After claiming, user can re-transfer BONDeths, back to `addressA`. 

### Impact

User can claim the amount higher than expected, in worse case scenario he can drain out all coupon token form distributor contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of relying on bond balance of claimer, implement internal accounting that how much BONDeths, he actually hold during pool periods.
