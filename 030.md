# Last user cant redeem bondETH because of division by zero

### Summary

when redeeming, the function `Pool::getRedeemAmount` is used to calculate the amount user would get.
but the calculation where the `collateralLevel` are calculated is have division by zero vulnerability

```solidity
    if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND) {
@>    collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
```

### Root Cause

In [Pool.sol#L477-L507](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L477-L507) the function `getRedeemAmount` is used to calculate the amount of reserve token an user would get after redeeming.

but given the parameter `depositAmount` and `bondSupply` (whose value is from bondToken.totalSupply() ) populated by quantity of `bondETH`, if it is the last user to redeem the `depositAmount` and `bondSupply` are the same amount. thus making the division by zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. alice and bob predeposit 5 reserveToken each
2. predeposit create pool
3. alice and bob claim the bond token
4. alice redeem all her bond token
5. bob redeem all his bond token, but it would revert

### Impact

the last user who redeem cannot redeem their token, making they loss their funds.

### PoC

add this to `test/Pool.t.sol`:

```solidity
  function test_PoC_cannotRedeemAllBondToken() public {
    setEthPrice(3000e8);
    // governance and predeposit have same role so this can simulate predeposit
    vm.startPrank(governance);
    address alice = makeAddr("alice");
    address bob = makeAddr("bob");

    // Mint and approve reserve tokens
    Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);
    uint256 totalReserve = 1000 ether; // I set ridiculous amount of reserve because another another issue prevent this to succeed if lower
    rToken.mint(governance, totalReserve);
    rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), totalReserve);

    // create pool with 
    uint256 bondAmount = 500 ether;
    uint256 leverageAmount = 250 ether;
    Pool pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(params, totalReserve, bondAmount, leverageAmount, "", "", "", "", false));

    // simulate predeposit claiming:
    vm.startPrank(governance);
    pool.bondToken().transfer(alice, bondAmount/2);
    pool.bondToken().transfer(bob, bondAmount/2);
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // redeem at 6 months
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 180 days);

    // set price so it not stale
    setEthPrice(3000e8);

    // simulate all user who do predeposit redeeming
    vm.prank(alice);
    pool.redeem(Pool.TokenType.BOND, bondAmount/2, 0);

    vm.prank(bob);
    vm.expectRevert();
    pool.redeem(Pool.TokenType.BOND, bondAmount/2, 0);
  }

```

then run the command `forge test --mt test_PoC_cannotRedeemAllBondToken`

the test would revert as expected

```bash
Ran 1 test for test/Pool.t.sol:PoolTest
[PASS] test_PoC_cannotRedeemAllBondToken() (gas: 1918759)
Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 132.07ms (38.28ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 204.06ms (132.07ms CPU time): 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

### Mitigation

I would suggest to having `bondSupply` as a contract state so it would not reduced everytime someone redeems.
this also makes the amount of redeeming more stable, because if it is derived from `totalSupply` the earliest redeemer would have reduced amount as it would divided by `totalSupply - depositAmount` where `totalSupply` at it max value.
