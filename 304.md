# BondOracleAdapter::latestRoundData Returns X96 Result

### Summary

The `BondOracleAdapter::latestRoundData` function is responsible for returning the TWAP price over a specified `twapInterval`. Typically, the `latestRoundData` function returns prices with 8 or 18 decimal places (as Chainlink does, for example). However, in the BondOracleAdapter::latestRoundData, the number is not properly sanitized and is returned in an `X96` format.

### Root Cause

X96 is a format used by Uniswap to perform transactions without losing precision. We can see that this is the format in which the result of BondOracleAdapter::latestRoundData is returned:

```solidity
function getPriceX96FromSqrtPriceX96(uint160 sqrtPriceX96) public pure returns(uint256) {
    return FullMath.mulDiv(sqrtPriceX96, sqrtPriceX96, FixedPoint96.Q96);
}
```

### Impact

This causes compatibility issues since, when used as an oracle, this problem negatively affects the entire protocol.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The number should be divided by Q96, depending in the decimals desired, to properly normalize it.
