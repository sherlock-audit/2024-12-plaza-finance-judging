# As the coupon amount to distribute to the bondETH holders increases, bidding will be less accessible to users with limited funds .

### Summary

In Auction contract for a user to bid [he has to sell a minimum amount of coupon tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L127), this minimum is determined by [`slotSize()` function ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L382-L384), which is `totalBuyCouponAmount / maxBids`, and since [maxBids value is hardcoded](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L560) and cannot be changed once the Pool contract is deployed, if an auction is started with a high `couponAmountToDistribute`  the minimum amount to bid will be also high relatively to what a commun user can bid .
### **For example :** 
if the shares per Token is 2.5 USDC per 1 bondETH .
- for 1 million bondETH, the minimum to bid is 2500 usdc .
- for 10 millions bondETH, the minimum amount to bid is 25000 usdc .
- for 100 millions bondETH, the minimum amount to bid is 250000 usdc .

### Root Cause

maxBids is Hardcoded and couponAmountToDistribute can be relatively high .

### Internal Pre-conditions

maxBids is Hardcoded .

### External Pre-conditions

High couponAmountToDistribute amount .

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

less people will bid, and consequently : 
- there will be less competition on the auction and the few bidders will get advantageous prices and the protocol desadvantageous prices .
- the auction will not gather the needed amount for bondETH holders to get paid .

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

make the maxBids changeable by the governor contract .
