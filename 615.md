# Decimal Precision Mismatch in Market Rate Comparison Causes Incorrect Redemption Rates

### Summary

Lack of decimal normalization between marketRate (in reserve oracle decimals) and redeemRate (6 decimals) in Pool's getRedeemAmount will cause incorrect price comparisons when the reserve token's oracle uses decimals other than 6, leading to incorrect redemption rates being used.

### Root Cause

In Pool.sol's [getRedeemAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L515-L525) function,  [marketRate (normalized to reserve oracle decimals)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L443-L463) is directly compared with redeemRate (BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION which has 6 decimals): without proper decimal normalization:
```solidity
// marketRate is normalized to reserve oracle decimals
marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD).normalizeAmount(
    getOracleDecimals(address(bondToken), USD),
    oracleDecimals  // reserve token oracle decimals
);

// In getRedeemAmount:
// redeemRate has 6 decimals (BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION)
redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;

// marketRate has reserve oracle decimals
if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
    redeemRate = marketRate;
}
```

If the reserve token's oracle uses decimals other than 6 (e.g., 8 decimals for WBTC/USD feed or 18 decimals for a Balancer pool feed), the comparison will be incorrect due to decimal mismatch.

For example:
marketRate = 95e18 > redeemRate 100e6

but 95 usd < 100 usd

### Attack Path

### Impact

When reserve token oracle decimals differ from 6, the price comparison will be skewed, potentially leading to:

Market rate appearing larger/smaller than intended
Wrong redemption rate being selected
Users receiving unfavorable redemption rates

For example, with a reserve oracle using 8 decimals, market rates will appear 100x larger than they should when compared to redeemRate.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Normalize marketRate to 6 decimals (PRECISION) before comparison:

```solidity
// normalize marketRate to PRECISION (6) decimals for comparison
if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate.normalizeAmount(oracleDecimals, 6) < redeemRate) {
    redeemRate = marketRate.normalizeAmount(oracleDecimals, 6);
}
```
