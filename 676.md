# Precision loss in `PreDeposit.sol` in case `reserveToken` is not with `18` decimals

medium

## Summary 
The purpose of the `PreDeposit` contract is for the assets to simply sit in it and then get rolled into the `Pool` contract and the users are given `bondETH` and `levETH` when the main protocol launches. Usually the reserveToken is going to be `wstETH`,`wETH`,`stETH` - all these are with `18` decimals, but there's no guarantee the reserveToken is not going to be with less or more decimals than that and this can lead to precision loss.

## Impact
The impact is `high` but the likelihood is `low`, that's why I consider it a `medium`

## PoC
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L172-L173
In PreDeposit.sol -> claim() -> L172-L173 there are these calculations where `reserveAmount`'s decimals are not taken into account.

```solidity
function claim() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (pool == address(0)) revert ClaimPeriodNotStarted();
    
    uint256 userBalance = balances[msg.sender];
    if (userBalance == 0) revert NothingToClaim();

    address bondToken = address(Pool(pool).bondToken());
    address leverageToken = address(Pool(pool).lToken());

>    uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
>    uint256 userLeverageShare = (leverageAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
    ....
```

For simplicity let's take these numbers:
`bondAmount` = `1e18`
`userBalance` = `50e18`
`reserveAmout` = `100e18`

`uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;`

Look at the happy path

```solidity
(1e18 * 50e18) / 100e18 = 0.5e18
```

but if since the reserveAmount is not scaled if the token is with 6 decimals for example the calculations will be like this 

```solidity
(1e18 * 50e18) / 100e6 = 500000000000e18
```

which will cause minting too much bondETH/levETH tokens

## Recommendation
Scale the `reserveAmount` or use the `lib/Utils.normalizeAmount()`
