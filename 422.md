# Inconsistent `sharesPerToken` Usage Causes Incorrect Claim Amount

### Summary

`Pool::sharesPerToken` is the amount of coupons paid out each distribution period per bondETH. It is set when a pool is created and can also be changed via `Pool::setSharesPerToken()` by `GOV_ROLE`.

The protocol intends for governance to be able to set the `sharesPerToken` for the current period at any point except during an auction. If the `sharesPerToken` is changed, for example from 2.5e6 to 3e6, then 3e6 is the amount bondETH holders should receive in coupons for the distribution period it was changed in, even if this change occurs just before the auction starts for that distribution period.

When `Pool::setSharesPerToken()` is called, it updates`Pool::sharesPerToken`:
```solidity
function setSharesPerToken(uint256 _sharesPerToken) external NotInAuction onlyRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE()) {
@>  sharesPerToken = _sharesPerToken;
    emit SharesPerTokenChanged(sharesPerToken);
  }
```

When the distribution period ends and the auction begins, `Pool::startAuction()` calculates the amount of coupons to sell by taking the current `Pool::sharesPerToken` amount and multiplying it by the total suppy of bond tokens:
```solidity
function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
...
    uint256 normalizedTotalSupply = bondToken.totalSupply().normalizeAmount(bondDecimals, maxDecimals);
@>  uint256 normalizedShares = sharesPerToken.normalizeAmount(sharesDecimals, maxDecimals);

   
@>  uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)
        .toBaseUnit(maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
...
  }
```

However, when bondETH holders go to claim their coupons after a successful auction by calling `Distributor::claim`, the sharesPerToken amount utilized in the calculation is the sharesPerToken that was set when the period first began rather than the new sharesPerToken it was set to:

```solidity
function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
...

@>  uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
...
  }

function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
@>    shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }
```

This means, if the sharesPerToken amount increased, when users go to claim, they'll receive less than they're entitled to. If the sharesPerToken amount decreased, the first users who claim will receive more coupons than they're entitled to making the last users who claim unable to withdraw due to insufficient funds in the Distributor contract.

Also note, the same problem exists if the protocol decides to wait until the next period for the change in sharesPerToken to take effect because in this situation, either there will be too many coupons generated at auction or not enough, depending on the direction sharesPerToken changed. 


### Root Cause

When `Pool::setSharesPerToken()` is called, it doesn't update `bondToken.globalPool.sharesPerToken`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. During a distribution period, `GOV_ROLE` calls `Pool::setSharesPerToken`, either increasing or decreasing.
2. The distribution period ends and someone calls `Pool:startAuction()`. 10 days later, `Pool::endAuction()` is called and the auction ends successfully.
3. Someone calls `Pool:distribute()` to distribute the coupons to the Distributor contract.
4. bondETH holders start calling `Distributor::claim()`, but because their shares are calculated using the old `sharesPerToken` they either receive too little or not enough coupons.  If the sharesPerToken amount increased, when users go to claim, they'll receive less than they're entitled to. If the sharesPerToken amount decreased, the first users who claim will receive more coupons than they're entitled to making the last users who claim unable to withdraw due to insufficient funds in the Distributor contract.


### Impact

Loss of funds for bondETH holders.

### Mitigation

Update `bondToken.globalPool.sharesPerToken` when `Pool::setSharesPerToken()`is called.
