# Auction can be intentionally failed by bidding above poolSaleLimit ratio

### Summary

The auction will be set to a failed state if `totalSellReserveAmount` exceeds `poolSaleLimit` ratio. A malicious actor can grief by always bidding a high amount, refunding his full amount afterwards.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L342

```solidity
function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
  state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
} else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
@>    state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
} else {
  state = State.SUCCEEDED;
  Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
  IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```

Nothing prevents a malicious actor intentionally bidding in order to increase `totalSellReserveAmount` over the limit ratio for the ongoing auction, causing it to fail. After auction has ended he can fully refund his bid.

```solidity
function claimRefund(uint256 bidIndex) auctionExpired auctionFailed whenNotPaused external {
Bid storage bidInfo = bids[bidIndex];
if (bidInfo.bidder != msg.sender) revert NothingToClaim();
if (bidInfo.claimed) revert AlreadyClaimed();

bidInfo.claimed = true;
IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.sellCouponAmount);

emit BidRefundClaimed(bidIndex, bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.sellCouponAmount);
}
```

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker makes a high bid (eg in last few minutes of auction) to increase the `totalSellReserveAmount` over the `poolSaleLimit` ratio.
2. Since `poolSaleLimit` can't be changed for ongoing auctions, there is almost no risk for attacker.
3. After auction has failed, he refunds back his deposit.

### Impact

Griefing attack on auction functionality.

### Mitigation

Reduce accepted bids/totalSellReserveAmount to the proportion of wanted limit.
