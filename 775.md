# No slippage control while joining the balancerPool

### Summary

In `BalancerRouter.sol::joinBalancerAndPredeposit()` it is joining Balancer Pool and deposit in the PreDeposit contract but while joining balancer pool there is no slippage control on how much `balancerPoolTokenReceived` will be receive and deposited in PreDeposit contract.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L31

`BalancerRouter.sol::joinBalancerAndPredeposit()`:-

```javascript
    function joinBalancerAndPredeposit(
        bytes32 balancerPoolId,
        address _predeposit,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
@>      uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = joinBalancerPool(balancerPoolId, assets, maxAmountsIn, userData);
        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(_predeposit, balancerPoolTokenReceived);
        PreDeposit(_predeposit).deposit(balancerPoolTokenReceived, msg.sender);
        return balancerPoolTokenReceived;
    }
```

When joining Balancer pool with assets to get Pool tokens it is not checking for slippage. Because of which users may deposit less pool token than expected.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

It will result in loss of users as when joining balancer pool and deposit, it may return less poolToken than expected and there is no check for minimum amount that the users is expected to deposit in PreDeposit.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement slippage check in the function.
