# reserve token  amount will be less than expected when leverage tokens are redeemed because precision is multiplied after division in redeemRate calculation.

### Summary

when leverage token is redeemed , if collateralLevel > COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD, then leverage token’s redeemRate calculation is like this i.e redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION where PRECISION is multiplied after division. As a result, users will get less reserve amount for leverage tokens. There may come anather scenario i.e redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION; here if tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE is less than assetSupply, then redeemRate will be 0 which breaks protocol invariants i.e Redemption of leverage token shouldn't be zero as long as there are bonds issued.


### Root Cause

 see the redeemrate calculation i.e redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION where PRECISION is multiplied after division;

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, currently the  reserve token’s tvl in usd = 10000 in the pool, bondSupply = 60, assetSupply = levSupply = 30(just for example).
 
2. when leverage token is redeemed , if collateralLevel > COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD, then leverage token’s redeemRate calculation is like this i.e redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION where PRECISION is multiplied after division;

3. so  redeemRate = ((10000-(60*100))/30)*1000000 = (4000/30)*1000000 = 133000000 = 133.

4. so here redeemRate should be 133.33 but as PRECISION is multiplied after division, so redeemRate is less i.e 133.so users will get less reserve amount for leverage tokens. As a result, reserve tokens backed by leverage tokens may be stuck in the pool contract.

 Another scenario, 

redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION; here if tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE is less than assetSupply, then redeemRate will be 0 which breaks protocol invariants i.e Redemption of leverage token shouldn't be zero as long as there are bonds issued.

### Impact

users will get less reserve amount for leverage tokens. As a result, reserve tokens backed by leverage tokens may be stuck in the pool contract. redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION; here if tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE is less than assetSupply, then redeemRate will be 0 which breaks protocol invariants i.e Redemption of leverage token shouldn't be zero as long as there are bonds issued.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 multiply PRECISION with (tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE) before dividing by assetSupply in the redeemRate calculation.
