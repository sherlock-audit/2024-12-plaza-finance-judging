# Inflation of totalSellReserveAmount in the Auction contract.

### Summary

in the `Auction.sol` contract, a malicious user can inflate the totalSellReserveAmount by reserving a large amount of ETH with their bid in the last seconds of the Auction, leading to auction failure due to insufficient pool reserve.

### Root Cause

In the `Auction.sol` contract, the [`endAuction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336) function will always revert due to insufficient pool reserve.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user simply needs to place a bid in the last seconds of the auction.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Auction constantly fails due to insufficient reserve amount in the pool, which leads to bondEth holders not being able to receive coupon tokens.

### PoC

none
