# Auction.sol :: bid() if coupon or reserve token does not have 18 decimals and a partial removal is performed, it result in the removal of more or fewer assets from the user's balance.

### Summary

`bid()` is used to place a bid in an auction. The issue arises because the code assumes that all ERC20 tokens use 18 decimals, which is not always the case. If the coupon  or reserve token has a different decimals, and a partial removal is performed, the user's balance may be reduced by more than intended or by less.

### Root Cause

[bid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125-L171) is used to place a bid in an auction. If `currentCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount`, it becomes necessary to remove some bids because the maximum allowable amount has been exceeded. This adjustment is handled by the `removeExcessBids()` function.
```solidity
function removeExcessBids() internal {
    if (currentCouponAmount <= totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      return;
    }

    uint256 amountToRemove = currentCouponAmount - totalBuyCouponAmount;
    uint256 currentIndex = lowestBidIndex;

    while (currentIndex != 0 && amountToRemove != 0) {
      // Cache the current bid's data into local variables
      Bid storage currentBid = bids[currentIndex];
      uint256 sellCouponAmount = currentBid.sellCouponAmount;
      uint256 prevIndex = currentBid.prevBidIndex;

      if (amountToRemove >= sellCouponAmount) {
        // Subtract the sellAmount from amountToRemove
        amountToRemove -= sellCouponAmount;

        // Remove the bid
        _removeBid(currentIndex);

        // Move to the previous bid (higher price)
        currentIndex = prevIndex;
@>    } else {
        // Calculate the proportion of sellAmount being removed
      
        uint256 proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount;
        
        // Reduce the current bid's amounts
        currentBid.sellCouponAmount = sellCouponAmount - amountToRemove;
        currentCouponAmount -= amountToRemove;

        uint256 reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18);
        currentBid.buyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount - reserveReduction;
        totalSellReserveAmount -= reserveReduction;
        
        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
        
        amountToRemove = 0;
        emit BidReduced(currentIndex, currentBid.bidder, currentBid.buyReserveAmount, currentBid.sellCouponAmount);
      }
    }
  }
```
When the amount of a bid is sufficient to reduce the `amountToRemove`, the system calculates the proportion of the bid needed to adjust the total within the `totalBuyCouponAmount` range. This calculation uses the formula `proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount`. The issue here is that the formula assumes all ERC20 tokens have 18 decimals by scaling by `1e18`, which is incorrect. For instance, if `amountToRemove` is in a token with 18 decimals (buy token) and `sellCouponAmount` is in a token with 6 decimals (sell token), this causes the calculated proportion to be overestimated.

As a result, when adjusting the user's balance with `reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18)`, the proportion has not been properly scaled, leading to an excess of 12 decimals (since 18 - 6 = 12). This causes the user's balance to be reduced more than intended.

In the case where `amountToRemove` is in a token with 6 decimals (buy token) and `sellCouponAmount` is in a token with 18 decimals (sell token), the opposite problem occurs. The user's balance will be reduced less than intended because the proportion is scaled with 12 decimals fewer than intended (due to the difference of 6 - 18 decimals in the proportion calculation).

This issue can arise because, in the contest specifications, tokens like USDC and WBTC will be used. On the BASE blockchain, [USDC](https://basescan.org/token/0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913) has 6 decimals, while [WBTC](https://basescan.org/token/0x0555E30da8f98308EdB960aa94C0Db47230d2B9c) has 8 decimals.

### Internal Pre-conditions

An auction contract needs to be created with one token having 18 decimals, such as WETH, and the other token having fewer decimals, like 6 for USDC or 8 for WBTC.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

The user's balances will be reduced by more or less than intended.

### PoC

To better understand the issue, let's look at three examples where one token has 18 decimals and the other has 6 decimals.

**Example 1: coupon = 18 decimals (WETH), reserve = 6 decimals (USDC) – Incorrect Scaling**

1. `bid()` is called with `currentCouponAmount = 110_000e18`, `totalBuyCouponAmount = 100_000e18`, and `sellCouponAmount = 10_000e6`.
2. `amountToRemove = 110_000e18 - 100_000e18 = 10_000e18`. The lowest bid has `10_000e6` (`sellCouponAmount`), so we need to remove the full bid amount because `amountToRemove >= sellCouponAmount`. However, this is incorrect because it compares a token with 18 decimals to one with 6 decimals.
3. When performing `amountToRemove -= sellCouponAmount`, `amountToRemove` has 18 decimals while `sellCouponAmount` has 6 decimals. This discrepancy will cause more bids to be removed than intended.

**Example 2: coupon = 18 decimals (WETH), reserve = 18 decimals (wstETH) – Correct Scaling**

1. `bid()` is called with `currentCouponAmount = 110_000e18`, `totalBuyCouponAmount = 100_000e18`, and `sellCouponAmount = 10_000e18`.
2. `amountToRemove = 110_000e18 - 100_000e18 = 10_000e18`. The lowest bid has `20_000e18`, so we need to calculate the proportion.
3. `proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount = 10_000e18 * 1e18 / 10_000e18 = 1e18` (correct scaling). The next step is to calculate the `reserveReduction` of the bid using this correct proportion, assuming `currentBid.buyReserveAmount = 30_000e18`.
4. `reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18) = 30_000e18 * 1e18 / 1e18 = 30_000e18`.
5. Updating the user's balance: `currentBid.buyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount - reserveReduction = 30_000e18 - 30_000e18 = 0`. 
6. The user’s balance is correctly updated.

**Example 3: coupon = 6 decimals (USDC), reserve = 18 decimals (WETH) – Incorrect Scaling**

1. `bid()` is called with `currentCouponAmount = 110_000e6`, `totalBuyCouponAmount = 100_000e6`, and `sellCouponAmount = 10_000e18`.
2. `amountToRemove = 110_000e6 - 100_000e6 = 10_000e6`. The lowest bid has `10_000e18` (`sellCouponAmount`), so we need to calculate the proportion because  `amountToRemove < sellCouponAmount`.
3. We enter inside the proportion but this is not correct because we are comparing a token with 18 deciamls with one of 6 decimals. `proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount = 10_000e6 * 1e18 / 10_000e18 = 1e6` (incorrect scaling). The next step is to calculate the `reserveReduction` of the bid using this reduced proportion, assuming `currentBid.buyReserveAmount = 30_000e6`.
4. `reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18) = 30_000e6 * 1e6 / 1e18 = 0` (due to Solidity truncation).
5. Updating the user’s balance: `currentBid.buyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount - reserveReduction = 10_000e6 - 0`. 
6. The user receives tokens, but their balance is not updated correctly.

Additionally, these incorrect calculations will impact the `totalSellReserveAmount`, leading to inaccurate accounting.

### Mitigation

To solve the problem, scale the decimals of the tokens involved to ensure correct calculations.
