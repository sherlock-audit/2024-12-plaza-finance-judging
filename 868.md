# Irretrievable Loss of Coupon  from Missed Distribution Periods

### Summary

 The `distribute` function in the `Pool` contract only allows for the distribution of tokens from the immediately preceding period. If a distribution is missed for a given period, those tokens cannot be distributed in subsequent periods, leading to potential loss or misallocation of rewards.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Tokens from missed distribution periods remain undistributed. Potential financial impact due to undistributed rewards. Users receive lesser tokens.

### PoC

If Distribution Period A ends without calling distribute, and subsequent periods B and C also end, calling distribute after Period C only processes tokens from Period B. Tokens from Period A remain undistributed and are effectively lost due to the current implementation, which only handles the most recent period's tokens. This results in users missing out on rewards from Period A, impacting both financial outcomes and trust in the protocol.

### Mitigation

Implement a mechanism to track and allow distribution of tokens from all the  periods., not just the previous one .
