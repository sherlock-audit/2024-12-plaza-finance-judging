# Attacker will prevent some market makers and users from depositing in the `PreDeposit`

### Summary

Any address can deposit a signifcant amount in the PreDeposit in order for `reserveAmount == reserveCap`preventing market makers and other users from depositing. Attacker will then withdraw everything he deposited right before the pool creation. The pool will end up having less liquidity than expected. Pool might as well not be created at all if the attacker is the first to deposit.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L119

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `reserveAmount < reserveCap`
2. `reserveAmount == 0` (optional)
3. `depositStartTime < block.timestamp < depositEndTime`

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deposits to the `PreDeposit` in a way that `reserveAmount = reserveCap`
2. right before `depositEndTime` attacker withdraws his deposit

### Impact

- Pool might not be created if the attacker is the first to deposit
```solidity
function createPool() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (reserveAmount == 0) revert NoReserveAmount();
```
- Pool is created but many market makers and users couldn't deposit

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a whitelisting mechanism to the `PreDeposit` contract. Or redesign the contract in a way that everyone can deposit as much as they want and after the preDeposit preiod the pool is deployed with a max of `reserveCap` with the rest reimbursed to those who wish, it requires some redesign to achieve that.
