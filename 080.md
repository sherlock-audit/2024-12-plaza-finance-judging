# `Auction::endAuction` result can be manipulated

### Summary

the reliance of `endAuction` function to the current reserveToken balance of the pool makes the outcome of the auction can be manipulated.

[Auction.sol#L336-L350](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336-L350)
```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
@>  } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

anyone with enough reserveToken balance or derivative token (lev/bondETH) can manipulate to change the outcome of current auction status to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`

### Root Cause

```solidity
(totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100)
```

the condition above can be manipulated by `Pool::create` or `Pool::redeem` because these two function change the state of `IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool)` at the end of auction duration (typically 10 days) or when the amount of `Auction::totalBuyCouponAmount ` is already fulfilled.

### Attack Path

consider a situation where:
`poolSaleLimit` = `90`

case if `pool balance =  100` and `totalSellReserveAmount` = `85`:

the auction would SUCCEEDED. but user with enough derivative token can redeem with the output of `~5.57` reserveToken and then call `Auction::endAuction`

the result would be
```bash
totalSellReserveAmount >= poolBalance * poolSaleLimit/100
85 >= (100 - 5.57) * 90/100
85 >= 94.43 * 90/100
85 >= 84.987 =>>> false =>>> status changed from SUCCEEDED to FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT
```

case if `pool balance =  100` and `totalSellReserveAmount` = `60`:

the auction would SUCCEEDED. but user with enough derivative token can redeem with the output of `~33.34` reserveToken and then call `Auction::endAuction`

the result would be
```bash
totalSellReserveAmount >= poolBalance * poolSaleLimit/100
60 >= (100 - 33.34) * 90/100
60 >= 66.66 * 90/100
60 >= 59.994 =>>> false =>>> status changed from SUCCEEDED to FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT
```

case if `pool balance =  100` and `totalSellReserveAmount` = `105`:

the auction would FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT. but user with enough reserveToken can call create with the input of `~16.67` reserveToken and then call `Auction::endAuction`

the result would be
```bash
totalSellReserveAmount >= poolBalance * poolSaleLimit/100
105 >= (100 + 16.67) * 90/100
105 >= 116.67 * 90/100
105 >= 105.003 =>>> true=>>> status changed from  FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT to SUCCEEDED
```

all the above manipulation require the user to have relative high amount of derivative/reserve token, but the fact that they can call create/redeem again to get whatever the original amount and token they have, this griefing attack can be considered to only require gas fee paid by attacker

### Impact

auction result can be manipulated, possibly to prevent the auction from succeeding. making the user loss the potential amount of coupon token from the auction bidder.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

when the auction is active (typically 10 days), consider to lock the `create` and `redeem` function inside the corresponding `Pool` contract
