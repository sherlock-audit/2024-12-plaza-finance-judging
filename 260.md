# `transferReserveToAuction` uses the wrong period, which is why `endAuction` will always fail, and the bidders' bids will be locked

### Summary

`endAuction` is called after an auction which then uses `transferReserveToAuction` which uses the wrong period. This means that the correct address for the auction cannot be found and it cannot be validated that the caller is the correct auction contract, which leads to a revert. This means that an auction cannot be ended and the bidders can no longer reclaim their bids.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L577-L580

In `Pool.sol:577` the wrong period is used because the current auction is for the last period. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L552-L567

This is because after an auction is started, in `Pool.sol:552` this auction is saved under the `currentPeriod` which is then increased by one in `Pool.sol:567`. This means that the period under which the current auction is saved is no longer in the `currentPeriod` but in the period before it. This means the period that should be used in `transferReserveToAuction` is the one before `currentPeriod`. After the wrong period was used to read the auction contract in `Pool.sol:579` and this is then simply the zero address, since the auction for the current period does not yet exist, the call is reverted in `Pool.sol:580` because msg.sender is not the zero address.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Not really pre conditions as this bug will happen when the protocol is used normally by the users.

### External Pre-conditions

There are no external contracts involved

### Attack Path

1. After the first distribution period is over, a user calls `startAuction`.
2. The bidders call the `bid` function on the Auction contract and transfer their USDC, which they want to sell, to the Auction contract.
3. After the auction, a user calls `endAuction` to conclude the auction. However, this call reverts because `transferReserveToAuction`, which is used within it, also reverts because of the bug.

### Impact

If an auction cannot be completed, it will always remain in `State.BIDDING`, which results in bidders not being able to reclaim their tokens using `claimRefund` (`Auction.sol:367`) because the auction was not moved into a failed state. Similarly, the bondEth holders will not receive their coupons because these cannot be transferred in `endAuction`.
