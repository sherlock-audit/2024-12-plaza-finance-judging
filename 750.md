# inconsistency in checking poolsaleLimit will causes more reserve tokens to be distributed to bidders which will cause protocol insolvency

### Summary

protocol conducts auction once for every distribution period to reward the users for holding bondeth tokens for that period.
and users will bid coupon tokens to take share of reserve tokens. these coupon tokens are then awarded for bondeth holders for that period.
here protocol selling reserve tokens to buy coupon tokens and for this protocol set a poolsaleLimit which indicates how much reserve token is maximum available to sell for bids in return of coupon tokens.
Let's say current period =X, bond tokens = Y1, reserve tokens = Z1 just before starting auction and sharesperToken =S and poolsaleLimit = 90.
Then code should be implemented in such a way that it should maximum sells 90% of reserve tokens available now that is 90(z1)/100.
but the check implemented to check this was wrong.

```solidity
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
```
 Let's say during auction period reserve token balance was increased by Z2. now total reserveBalance = Z1+Z2.so while checking we are checking weather totalSellReserveAmount >= 90(Z1+Z2)/100. instead of >=90(z1)/100.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
```
using  the  pool balance after the auction end to check wheater totalSellReserveAmount exceeds poolsaleLimit instead of using pool's balance of reserve token at the start of auction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

balance of reserveTokens should be increased during auction period

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

protocol insolvency as more reserveTokens are used to buy coupon tokens which will lead to protocol insolvency.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

introduce a statevariable who holds the  pool's balance of  reserveToken at the time when we start the auction which is then used to check poolsaleLimit
