# `poolSaleLimit` could allow the `Pool` to sell `sellReserveToken` more than the initial balance of that pool

### Summary

here is the `setPoolSaleLimit` function: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L176
this function shouldn't be able to set the `poolSaleLimit` bigger than 100,
since this value is used in the `Auction.endAuction()` to insure the `totalSellReserveAmount` is not bigger than the `poolSaleLimit` of that pool balance.
however, if it was more than 100 it will lead to a `Pool` selling `sellReserveToken` more than the initial balance of that pool.
see the check in the `Auction.endAuction()` :
```solidity
    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
```



### Root Cause

in the `Pool.setPoolSaleLimit()` function there is a missing check to insure the `poolSaleLimit` is less or equal to 100.
```solidity
  function setPoolSaleLimit(uint256 _poolSaleLimit) external onlyRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE()) {
    if (_poolSaleLimit < MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT) {
      revert PoolSaleLimitTooLow();
    }
    uint256 oldThreshold = poolSaleLimit;
    poolSaleLimit = _poolSaleLimit;
    emit PoolSaleLimitChanged(oldThreshold, _poolSaleLimit);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `GOV_ROLE` needs to set `poolSaleLimit` to be at least 101.
2. at the end of an `Auction` the `totalSellReserveAmount` need to be bigger than the reserve balance of that pool.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The last bidders who claim after an auction ended suffer a 100% loss of their coupon token and cannot claim the reserve they bid for.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add the following constant to `Pool.sol`:
```solidity
  uint256 private constant MAX_POOL_SALE_LIMIT = 100;
```
and implement `setPoolSaleLimit()` as follow:
```solidity
  function setPoolSaleLimit(uint256 _poolSaleLimit) external onlyRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE()) {
    if (_poolSaleLimit < MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT || _poolSaleLimit > MAX_POOL_SALE_LIMIT) {
      revert PoolSaleLimitTooLow();
    }
    uint256 oldThreshold = poolSaleLimit;
    poolSaleLimit = _poolSaleLimit;
    emit PoolSaleLimitChanged(oldThreshold, _poolSaleLimit);
  }
```
