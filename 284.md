# Unprotected Initialization Risk

### Summary

The contract is upgradeable but lacks proper initialization protection in the inheritance chain.

### Root Cause

In 'pool.sol:25' While the contract inherits from Initializable, there's no implementation of initialization functions for the inherited upgradeable contracts. This creates a risk where the implementation contract could be initialized by an attacker if proper initialization guards are not in place

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract must be uninitialized
2. Attacker needs to be the first to call an initialization function

### External Pre-conditions

1. None, can be executed by anyone if the implementation contract is not properly initialized


### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies an uninitialized implementation contract
2. Calls initialization function before legitimate initialization
3. Takes control of core contract functionality

### Impact

1. Potential hijacking of contract controls
2. Manipulation of core parameters
3. Unauthorized access to privileged functions

### PoC

// Assuming implementation contract address is known
Pool pool = Pool(implementationAddress);
// Attacker could initialize if not properly protected
pool.initialize(...) // Or similar initialization function


### Mitigation

Ensure proper initialization function:function initialize(...) public initializer {
    __Pausable_init();
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    // Initialize other parent contracts
    // Initialize pool-specific variables
}
Use _disableInitializers() in the constructor of the implementation contract
