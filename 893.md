# The attacker’s malicious bidding indirectly harms the interests of auction participants.

### Summary

In the `bid` function of the `Auction.sol` contract, there is a flaw in the check for the `buyReserveAmount` parameter.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L128-L129

The attacker can make malicious bids without taking on any risk (either not transacting or transacting at market price) by setting the `buyReserveAmount` parameter in the bid function to a value greater than
`(IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool)∗poolSaleLimit)/100`. This increases the costs for normal users participating in the auction, indirectly harming their interests.

### Root Cause

In the contract `Auction.sol`, the `bid` function does not check the condition `buyReserveAmount < (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100`, which allows the attacker to place bids (`buyReserveAmount > (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100`) attempting to purchase `ReserveTokens` in excess of the `poolSaleLimit`. The attacker’s malicious bid ultimately leads to three possible scenarios:

1. The attacker places a higher bid that removes (overrides) some normal users' bids. If no other participants place higher bids afterward, the malicious bid cannot be removed, leading the `endAuction` function to determine that the auction has failed.  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341-L343 At this point, the attacker recoups all of their attack costs, resulting in the auction's failure.
2. Some participants compete with the attacker in bidding, partially removing the attacker’s bids. If the buyReserveAmount in the attacker’s bid remains too high, the `endAuction` function may still determine that the auction has failed, allowing the attacker to recover all of their attack costs and resulting in the auction’s failure. If the `endAuction` function determines the auction is successful, the attacker still obtains the tokens at a near-market price.
3. Some participants compete with the attacker in bidding and completely remove the attacker's bids at a higher price. At this point, the `endAuction` function determines that the transaction was successful, allowing the attacker to successfully force participants to offer a higher price without any risk.

### Impact

This issue can be exploited by attackers, affecting the fairness of the auction and causing losses to users.

### Mitigation

Add a check for the `buyReserveAmount` parameter in the `bid` function to ensure that its value satisfies the condition  `buyReserveAmount < (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100` This will ensure risk and fairness in price competition during the bidding process.
