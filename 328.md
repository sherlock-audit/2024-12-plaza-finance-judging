# If an auction fails users will not be able to claim coupons

### Summary

There is a case in which the auction does not succeed. This can happen because there was not enough eth to sell, or there was no interest from the users to sell coupon tokens for eth. However when an auction does fail users are still allocated coupon tokens for the period, which failed to gather enough coupon tokens. Furthermore, when a new auction is started after a failed one this new auction will only try to gather coupons for its own period forgetting about the debt from the previous one. As a result some users will be unable to withdraw their coupon tokens.
In the distribute function we can also see that the pool will not send any tokens to the distributor when an auction does fail:

And when another auction is started after a failed one below we can see that it only accounts for current coupon tokens:

### Root Cause

A failed auction will still allocate user's the coupons for its period. However new auctions do not try to cover the debt of the previous auction. As a result not all users will be able to withdraw their own share of coupon tokens.

### Attack Path

1. Bob and Alice both own 1 BOND token each `currentPeriod = 0`
2. An auction is started and is successful. Now there are 5 USDC in the distributor contract.  `currentPeriod = 1`.
3. Another auction is started `currentPeriod = 2`
4. The auction however does not manage to sell the required tokens and fails.
5. However now Bob and Alice are allocated 5USDC each, but the `Distributor.sol` will only have 5 USDC so it will not manage to gather enough tokens for everyone

### Impact

Insolvency in the `Distributor.sol` due to failed auctions
