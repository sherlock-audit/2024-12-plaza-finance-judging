# Bond oracle adapter doesnt return the properly return the price from a concentrated liquidity pool

### Summary

the proper way of interpreting the price from a concentrated liquidity pool can be found [here](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v3-math-primer)

the formula should be 
ptoken0 = ((sqrtPriceX96/2**96))**2 / (10**(token1decimals - token0decimals))

ptoken1 = 1 / ptoken0 

this is a far cry from what is used in the code [here]()

the fomula used in the code is 
p = sqrtPriceX96**2)/2**96, this doesnt account for decimals and isnt even the right way to calculate raw price 


### Root Cause

wrong fetching of price 

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

core protocol functionalities would end up using wrong price for computation 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

correct method for retrieving price from cl pool should be implemented
