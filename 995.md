# Excess Assets Not Returned to User After Joining Balancer Pool in BalancerRouter.sol

### Summary

When users call joinBalancerPool() in BalancerRouter.sol, the function transfers the maximum asset amounts (maxAmountsIn) specified by the user to the contract. However, if the Balancer pool uses less than the specified maxAmountsIn, the excess assets remain locked in the BalancerRouter contract and are not returned to the user, resulting in a potential loss of funds.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L86

In the BalancerRouter.sol::joinBalancerPool() function, all maxAmountsIn amounts are transferred to the contract and passed to the Balancer pool. If the pool requires less than the maxAmountsIn, the unused assets are not refunded to the user:

```javascript
        function joinBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
@>          IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]);
        }

        IVault.JoinPoolRequest memory request = IVault.JoinPoolRequest({
            assets: assets,
@>          maxAmountsIn: maxAmountsIn,
            userData: userData,
            fromInternalBalance: false
        });
@>      balancerVault.joinPool(poolId, address(this), address(this), request);
    }
```

The joinPool() call in the Balancer Vault may use less than the maxAmountsIn, but there is no mechanism to refund the unused amounts to the user

### Internal Pre-conditions

maxAmountsIn specifies the maximum assets the user is willing to contribute to the pool

### External Pre-conditions

Users specify maxAmountsIn that exceeds the actual required amounts for joining the pool.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users lose any unused portions of their assets because the excess remains locked in the BalancerRouter contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement logic in joinBalancerPool() to return unused assets to the user after the Balancer poolâ€™s joinPool() operation is complete
