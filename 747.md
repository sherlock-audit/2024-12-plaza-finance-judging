# setFee function does not update the `lastFeeClaimTime` variable after modifying the fee percentage

### Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the Pool smart contract's setFee function. The failure to update the `lastFeeClaimTime` variable when the fee rate is changed allows retroactive application of the updated fee to prior periods.

### Root Cause

The `setFee` function does not update the `lastFeeClaimTime` variable after modifying the fee percentage. Consequently, the protocol calculates fees using the time elapsed since the last recorded `lastFeeClaimTime`, applying the updated fee rate retroactively to periods governed by the previous fee rate. 

The update to lastFeeClaimTime in setFee is conditional on whether getFeeAmount() > 0:

       if (getFeeAmount() > 0) {
           claimFees(); // Updates lastFeeClaimTime
       }
If `getFeeAmount()` returns 0, the `claimFees()` function is not called, and therefore, `lastFeeClaimTime` remains unchanged.

When `lastFeeClaimTime` is not updated, the new fee can retroactively apply to the entire time period since the last fee claim. This creates the potential for:

Manipulation: By increasing the fee rate without updating `lastFeeClaimTime`, authorized roles or governance can collect fees on past deposits for a longer duration than intended.
Unexpected user impact: Users may lose more funds than anticipated due to retroactive fee application.

Example Scenario:
Assume `lastFeeClaimTime` is Jan 1, 2025, and `setFee` is called on Jan 23, 2025.
If `getFeeAmount()` returns 0 (e.g., because the pool is empty or fees have already been claimed), `claimFees()` is not called.
`lastFeeClaimTime` remains Jan 1, 2025, even though the fee rate has changed.

This means the new fee rate applies retroactively from Jan 1, 2025, leading to unintended consequences.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability does exist because the update to `lastFeeClaimTime` depends on the condition `getFeeAmount() > 0`. If this condition is not met, `lastFeeClaimTime` is not updated, causing retroactive application of the new fee.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `setFee` function allows modification of the protocol's fee percentage by governance or authorized roles.

2. Fees are calculated using the `lastFeeClaimTime` variable and the current fee rate.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol is actively utilized, with reserves and accumulated fees present in the contract.

2. Authorized participants can invoke the setFee and claimFees functions.

### Attack Path


A participant or authorized entity increases the fee percentage to an inflated value.

They immediately invoke the claimFees() function.

The accumulated fees are calculated at the new rate for the entire duration since the last fee claim, allowing the actor to extract excessive fees unfairly.

User Overcharging:

The protocol applies the new fee rate retroactively to user interactions.

Users are penalized for past transactions under a higher fee rate they did not consent to, leading to financial losses.

### Impact

 A malicious actor could extract disproportionate fees, causing financial damage to the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To eliminate this vulnerability, include the following line in the `setFee` function to update the `lastFeeClaimTime` variable:

       lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
