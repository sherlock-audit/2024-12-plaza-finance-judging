# Malicious users with small bids can blacklist themselves from the coupon token(usdc) to prevent their bid from being removed when bidcount > maxbids

### Summary

when a new bid is added, if the current bid count is greater then maxBids, the lowest bid is removed [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L153-L158)

in the _removeBid function, it tries to transfer the tokens back to the bidder, if the token has a blacklist functionality( the expected coupon token is usdc which has blacklist functionlaity), the bidder can have themselves blacklisted from using the token causing any transfers to and from them to revert 

As a result, the call will revert and it will be impossible for the new bidder to create bid 

### Root Cause

blacklist functionality of coupon token

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions
