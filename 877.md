# Incorrect fees deduction logic calculation will cause incosistency in determing amount of bond/leverage token to mint in create flow

### Summary

Due to incorrect fee calculation logic at [Pool.sol:273](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273) which deducts fees for total amount of reserve token in Pool at time of create transaction rather then deducting fees according to separate amount during separate duration it will lead to incosistency in calculation of bond/leverage tokens to mint.

### Root Cause

The choice to calculate Pool fees at [Pool.sol:273](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273) is a mistake as it calculates fees for total reserve amount in Pool since last claim time rather then considering fees according to separate time since when the deposit of that funds happend through create call causing incosistency in calculation of amount of bond/leverage tokens to mint.

Example:- 
- Pool created with 1000 ETH of reserve tokens and 2% fees after 10 days User A called deposit of 10 ETH tokens through create function. 
- After 10 more days User B deposited 15 ETH tokens through create function
- After 10 more days User C deposits 20 ETH tokens through create function in calculation of deducting fees at [Pool.sol:273](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273) it should deduct fees for (1000ETH <> 30 days), (10ETH <> 20 days), (15ETH <> 10 days) but it will deduct on 1025 ETH for 30 days directly which is wrong and not intended.

### Attack Path

- Pool created with 1000 ETH of reserve tokens and 2% fees after 10 days User A called deposit of 10 ETH tokens through create function. 
- After 10 more days User B deposited 15 ETH tokens through create function
- After 10 more days User C deposits 20 ETH tokens through create function in calculation of deducting fees at [Pool.sol:273](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273) it should deduct fees for (1000ETH <> 30 days), (10ETH <> 20 days), (15ETH <> 10 days) but it will deduct on 1025 ETH for 30 days directly which is wrong and not intended.

### Impact

Due to incosistency in fees calculation logic at [Pool.sol:273](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273) during create function it will deduct more fees then it should leading to incosistency in calculation logic for minting bond/leverage token leading to loss in funds.

### Mitigation

Need to change the fees calculation method instead of calculating it with `IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR` which is wrong need to track through a variable at time of create and redeem and track amount based on timestamp when its created.
