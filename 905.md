# Missing initialization of PausableUpgradeable in Auction.sol and PreDeposit.sol contracts

### Summary

The Auction.sol and PreDeposit.sol contracts do not start the PausableUpgradeable contract in their initialize() functions. Because of this, functions that use whenNotPaused or whenPaused may not work correctly. This can cause problems with how the contracts work. To fix this, the initialize() functions must properly set up the PausableUpgradeable contract.

-PreDeposit.sol:

### Root Cause

In Auction.sol:93 and PreDeposit.sol:84, the initialize() functions do not call the __PausableUpgradeable_init() method. This method is important to start the PausableUpgradeable contract. Without it, the _paused state variable is not set, which causes problems for functions that use the whenNotPaused or whenPaused modifiers, like endAuction and bid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The initialize() function in Auction.sol is called but does not use __PausableUpgradeable_init(), so the _paused state variable is not set.

The initialize() function in PreDeposit.sol is called but does not use __PausableUpgradeable_init(), so the _paused state variable is not set.

The endAuction or bid function is called and uses the whenNotPaused modifier, but the _paused variable is not set.

The deposit, withdraw, createPool, or claim function is called and uses the whenNotPaused modifier, but the _paused variable is not set.

### External Pre-conditions

1.The Auction.sol or PreDeposit.sol contracts are deployed and used where __PausableUpgradeable_init() is not called

2.Users or others call the endAuction or bid functions in Auction.sol when the _paused variable is not set, which may causes problems.

3.Users or others call the withdraw, createPool, or claim functions in PreDeposit.sol when the _paused variable is not set, which may causes problems.

### Attack Path

1. A user or someone else calls the endAuction() or bid() functions in Auction.sol, which use the whenNotPaused modifier.

2. The PausableUpgradeable contract is not started properly, so the _paused variable is not set, causing problems in the whenNotPaused modifier.

3. Because of this, the user can skip the pause rules and use functions that should be blocked when paused.

4. PreDeposit.sol also has this problem because it depends on the PausableUpgradeable contract, which is not initialized.

5. This causes wrong actions or issues in the contracts, which could break functions.

### Impact

The contracts Auction.sol and PreDeposit.sol cannot enforce paused or unpaused states because the PausableUpgradeable contract is not set up.

This causes problems like undefined or wrong behavior in functions like endAuction() and bid(). 

Users may face problems like failed transactions, using paused functions without permission, or losing trust in how reliable the protocol is.
