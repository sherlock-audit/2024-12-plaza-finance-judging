# Remaining `balancerPoolToken` will not be returned


### Summary
In the `BalancerRouter::joinBalancerAndPredeposit` function, the remaining `balancerPoolToken` is not returned to the user, leading to potential loss of funds.

### Root Cause
The `PreDeposit::deposit(amount,)` function deposits up to the `reserveCap`. However, the `joinBalancerAndPredeposit()` function assumes that all `balancerPoolTokenReceived` is deposited, which may not be the case if the `reserveCap` is reached.

BalancerRounter.sol
    function joinBalancerAndPredeposit(
        ...
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        // Step 1: Join Balancer Pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = joinBalancerPool(balancerPoolId, assets, maxAmountsIn, userData);

        // Step 2: Approve balancerPoolToken for PreDeposit
        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(_predeposit, balancerPoolTokenReceived);

        // Step 3: Deposit to PreDeposit

        return balancerPoolTokenReceived;
    }

    function _deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) private checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
        if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached();

        address recipient = onBehalfOf == address(0) ? msg.sender : onBehalfOf;

        // if user would like to put more than available in cap, fill the rest up to cap and add that to reserves
        if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
125:        amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
        }

        balances[recipient] += amount;
        reserveAmount += amount;

        IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

        emit Deposited(recipient, amount);

### PoC
Included in Summary and Root Cause.

### Impact
Users who deposit last or after the reserveCap is reached may lose their funds, as their deposits will not be processed, and the remaining `balancerPoolToken` will not be returned.

### Mitigation
Return the remaining `balancerPoolToken` to the user.
