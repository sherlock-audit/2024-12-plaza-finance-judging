# Malicious user can leverage flash loans to claim all coupon rewards

### Summary

Anyone can call `Pool::startAuction`, which will deploy a new auction and checkpoint the `sharesPerToken` by calling [BondToken::increaseIndexedAssetPeriod](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L217-L229) for the holders of bond token, as long as `distributionPeriod` have passed since the last distribution.


```solidity
    function startAuction() external whenNotPaused {
        require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod < block.timestamp, DistributionPeriodNotPassed());
        require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());
       ....
        bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);
        lastDistribution = block.timestamp;
    }
```

The [Pool::distribute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589-L614) function distributes the rewards from the previous auction, so it can only be called after a new auction has started.

```solidity
 function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
        (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
        require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());

        uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
        uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();

        ....
```
The `Distributor::claim` function gets the shares of the user by calling`BondToken::getIndexedUserAmount`:

```solidity
    function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns (uint256) {
        IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
        uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

        for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
            shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
        }

        return shares;
    }
```
The function loops through the periods and accounts for all of the shares during the user's last updated one to the current.


The docs state that as long as the user holds during distribution, he should be eligible for the coupon rewards, however this opens up an opportunity for a flash loan attack.

The attacker can leverage this by minting bond tokens and calling `startAuction`, which will increase the current period and make it greater than the `userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod`, which makes the `Distributor` account his shares.

### Root Cause

`Pool` does not have a flashloan protection allowing users to claim all of the coupon rewards

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

When users claim through the [Distributor::claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L78-L110) 1 share == 1 coupon token, which the attacker can leverage by:
In one transaction:
- Takes a flashloan
 - Mints `couponAmountToDistribute / sharesPerToken` bond tokens
 - Calls `startAuction` to snapshot his balance
 - Calls `distribute` to distribute the coupon rewards to the distributor
 - Calls `Distributor::claim` to claim all of the shares
 - Burn the bond tokens 
 - Repays the flashloan

### Impact

All of the other holders will be left with no rewards

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider not allowing anyone to turn over a period, or apply some kind of snapshot protection
