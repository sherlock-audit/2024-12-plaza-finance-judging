# Users still have claim to tokens on a period even if the auction for that period failed

### Summary

once an auction is created, users automatically have a claim to the coupon tokens for that auction , if the auction fails, the claim is still there but the tokens are never received by the distribution contract 
This means that users would be able to claim their owed tokens from other users that havent claimed their tokens from past or future periods 

### Root Cause

users shares are updated to the current period - 1 and not the last period with a completed auction

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users will be able to claim funds belonging to other users 

### PoC

at period x 
total supply is 1000, 
share per token is 10 
bobs balance is 100 

auction is created for period x 
all users automatically have a claim to coupon tokens are period x 
for bob thats 100 * 10 = 1000 tokens 

the auction for period x fails 
bob still has his claim to 1000 tokens 
but the tokens were never received for that period 

auction is created for period x + 1 
assuming the same total supply and share per token 
this time the auction is successful and the distributor token recieves 10000 tokens 
bobs share from period x + 1 is 1000 so bob should own 10 percent of the tokens in distributor 
 but the total tokes owed to bob is 2000 tokens 
bob an withdraw his entire 2000 tokens leaving the distributor 1000 tokens in debt 

### Mitigation

In the bond token contract, users shares should be updated for a period if the auction for that period has started and it is successful
