# Malicious user can block others to predeposit by filling reserve cap

### Summary

Plaza allow users to predeposit before launch. When reserve cap of predeposits is reached, users won't be able to deposit anymore.

Malicious user can block predeposits from other users by filling reserve cap and withdraw his deposit right before the end time.

### Root Cause

Because users can freely deposit and withdraw without any constraint other than reserve cap, the first user can prevent other users from pre-depositing  by filling cap first.

And then withdraw right before end time without any punishment
