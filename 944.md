# Malicious user can create multiple bids to DOS aunction

### Summary

The bid function in Aunction.sol is vulnerable to a Sybil attack, allowing a malicious user to manipulate the auction by ensuring that currentCouponAmount is always lower than totalBuyCouponAmount. 
The malicious actor does this my creating small bids with small dust value until the max bid is reached.  Once the max bid is reached legitimate users can't create bids to augment currentCouponAmount to the normal value.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L351-L365

Root cause is in function Bid() which doesn't requires a minimum coupon value from users and allows users to make bids with any value which can miniscule enough for the user to create large amounts of bids filling up the max bid without reaching the totalBuyCouponAmount , which is expected by the endAunction to suffictiently finalize function.  


```solidity
function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {  //  if currenCouponAmount not up to totalBuyCoupon amount , aunction fails
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }

```

The vulnerability is so easy that the malicious actor can even using the same address to facilitate the attack as bids are allowed from the same address.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

-A malicious user creates multiple fake accounts or can use the same account numerous times
-The malicious user places multiple bids ensuring that max bids is reached while making sure that the currentCouponAmount is less than the totalBuyCouponAmount
-when max bid is reached legitimate users can't augment the aunction to totalBuyCouponAmount and aunction will always fail in endAuction()



### Impact

Auction will always fail and legitimate users are always Dosed

### PoC






### Mitigation

Add checks to validate the legitimacy of bids and also ensure that there is a minimum coupon value allowed to be processed for bids by users
