# A user will be able to always sabotage auctions

### Summary

The auction will only be able to sell up to 90% of all the reserve amount balance. This means that any whale user will be able to sabotage every auction, which will make it impossible for bond users to receive their rewards, leading to a direct loss of funds for the bond users.

### Root Cause

In the `endAuction` function we can see that if the totalSellReserveAmount exceeds 90% of the pool balance, the auction will fail due to the [following condition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341):
```solidity
 } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
            state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
        } 
```
However in the bid function there is no prevention from increasing the totalSellReserveAmount beyond this limit:
```solidity
 if (buyReserveAmount == 0) revert BidAmountTooLow(); 
        if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh(); 
```
This validation is not sufficient since it does not prevent users from exceeding the limit.
As a result any whale user will be able to completely sabotage every auction by a simple attack.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Attacker tries to buy huge amounts of reserve tokens at a higher price so that there bid will always succeed.
2. Because the amount the attacker attempts to buy is more than 90% of the total balance of the pool the auction will fail.
3. The attacker can call `claimRefund` to receive their locked amount of coupon tokens

### Impact

Any whale user will be able to grief every auction which will result in definite loss of revenue for bond holders.
Also this attack will require locking huge amount of coupon tokens in the contract for only one second in order to fail the auction:
- attacker calls `bid` one second before the `endTime`. 
- attacker calls `endAuction` exactly in the `endTime`.
- attacker calls `claimBid` at the `endTime`
Given there are no specific conditions and the attack can be executed by anyone only locking the attackers funds for one second, resulting in loss for the bond holders - High severity.
