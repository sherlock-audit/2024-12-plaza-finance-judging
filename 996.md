# Pool Sale Limit  Causes Unnecessary Auction Failure

### Summary

A vulnerability has been identified in the auction mechanism where the auction fails unnecessarily when the `currentCouponAmount` exactly matches the `totalBuyCouponAmount`, and the `totalSellReserveAmount` exactly equals the pool’s calculated sale limit. This failure occurs even though the bid target is achieved, causing user dissatisfaction, wasted bidding efforts, and lost opportunities for the pool to collect funds. By refining the auction logic, this unnecessary failure can be avoided, ensuring smoother functionality and a better user experience.

Vulnerability Context:
The condition `totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100` checks if the `totalSellReserveAmount` exceeds the pool's sale limit.
If the pool balance of sellReserveToken is very low (or zero), this calculation will trigger the auction to fail, even if sufficient bids are placed, resulting in an unintended failure (Edge Case 1) or an unintended conflict when the sale limit coincides with valid bids (Edge Case 2).

### Root Cause

The issue arises from the following logic in the endAuction function:

     else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
         state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
     }

The comparison >= triggers a failure state when `totalSellReserveAmoun`t equals the pool sale limit. Although the condition ensures the pool doesn’t exceed its sale threshold, it also unnecessarily invalidates cases where the pool sale limit is precisely met, even if the bidding target is satisfied.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Auction Configuration:

1. The auction has defined a pool sale limit (e.g., 50%).

2. The auction’s `totalBuyCouponAmount` is set.

Logic Dependence:

1. The `endAuction` function is called after the auction period has expired.

2. The `poolSaleLimit` condition is triggered when calculating totalSellReserveAmount.

### External Pre-conditions

Bid Structure:

1. Sufficient bids have been placed to meet the `totalBuyCouponAmount`.

2. The sum of the bids’ reserve amounts equals the pool sale limit.

Pool Constraints:

1. The pool’s balance of the `sellReserveToken` is correctly defined.

2. The pool’s sale limit is strictly enforced in the contract.

### Attack Path

Example Scenario

Auction Configuration:

Auction Target: 10,000 $COUPON

Pool Balance: 20,000 $USDT

Pool Sale Limit: 50% of the pool’s balance = .

Bids Received:

Alice bids 4,000 $USDT for 4,000 $COUPON.

Bob bids 3,000 $USDT for 3,000 $COUPON.

Charlie bids 3,000 $USDT for 3,000 $COUPON.

Totals:

currentCouponAmount = 4,000 + 3,000 + 3,000 = 10,000 $COUPON

totalSellReserveAmount = 4,000 + 3,000 + 3,000 = 10,000 $USDT

Execution:

currentCouponAmount == totalBuyCouponAmount: True (bid target met).

totalSellReserveAmount >= poolSaleLimit: True (sale limit exactly reached).

Result:

The auction fails with the state FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT, despite fully meeting the bidding target.

### Impact



1. Bid targets that are fully met may still result in refunds, harming the credibility and efficiency of the auction system.

2. Results in the auction pool failing to collect funds even when the bid target is achieved.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, modify the auction logic to treat cases where the `totalSellReserveAmount` exactly equals the pool sale limit as valid and allow the auction to succeed. This can be achieved by replacing the >= comparison with > in the relevant condition:

     else if (totalSellReserveAmount > (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
         state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
     }

This ensures auctions succeed when the bid target and pool sale limit are exactly met.
