# distribute function can be called twice

### Summary

The `Pool.distribute()` function can be called twice for the same auction, leading to uncontrollable coupon funds giveaway to users.

### Root Cause

In `Pool.distribute()` function there is no state update, that the function has already been called. Also it is not restricted. Hence this function can be called several times for the same auction by any user, and `couponAmountToDistribute` will be transfered twice, or more times.
