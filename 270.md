# `Auction.sol::bid()` may break if user is blacklisted after making a bid

### Summary

Function `bid()` calls `removeExcessBids()` and `_removeBid` to ensure lower bids are discarded accordingly. However if, for any reason, a user gets USDC blacklisted after having made a bid, this function will break everytime anyone attempts to make a higher bid, or a bid after `maxBids` has been reached.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Although unlikely, the impact would not be negligible. Any attempt to make new bids could fail. 
The blacklisted user would still benefit as he would still be eligible to receive reserve tokens, if he had made the highest bid from the moment he entered the auction.

### PoC

The issue lies in the safeTransfer calls, which would cause the entire functions to revert and with them the `bid()` function as well:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L286C5-L286C11

```javascript
  function removeExcessBids() internal {
    .
    .
    .        
        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
@>      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);//@audit
        
        amountToRemove = 0;
        emit BidReduced(currentIndex, currentBid.bidder, currentBid.buyReserveAmount, currentBid.sellCouponAmount);
      }
    }
  }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L286C5-L286C11

```javascript
  function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
    .
    .
    .
    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
@>  IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);//@audit

    emit BidRemoved(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);

    delete bids[bidIndex];
    bidCount--;
  }
```

### Mitigation

Instead of pushing funds out of the contract, store these amounts in the contract so that users can pull them themselves.
