# The joinBalancerPool() function does not return the remaining assets to the user.


## Summary
The joinBalancerPool() function does not return the remaining assets to the user.

## Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L65

```javascript
  function joinBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        // Transfer assets from user to this contract
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
@>            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
@>            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]);
        }

        IVault.JoinPoolRequest memory request = IVault.JoinPoolRequest({
            assets: assets,
@>            maxAmountsIn: maxAmountsIn,
            userData: userData,
            fromInternalBalance: false
        });

        // Join Balancer pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        balancerVault.joinPool(poolId, address(this), address(this), request);
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        return balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter - balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore;
    }
```
It can be observed that the user transferred the maxAmountsIn assets to the BalancerRouter contract. However, during the JoinPoolRequest() process, the assets may not necessarily use up the full maxAmountsIn, as maxAmountsIn represents the maximum amount that can be used. Therefore, there might be some remaining assets that need to be refunded to the user.


## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path


## Impact
The user loses a portion of their funds(assets).

## PoC

## Mitigation
Refund the unused funds(assets) to the user.
