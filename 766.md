# Incorrect Precision Adjustment in Token Rate Calculations

### Summary


A missing scalling by **PRECISION** in the calculation of `creationRate` and `redeemRate` for `TokenType.BOND` and `TokenType.LEVERAGE` will cause an underestimation of the creation and redemption rates for users creating or `redeeming bond/leverage` tokens. This occurs because the adjustment to `80%/20%` of the vault’s collateral value per `bond/leverage` token does not account for the required precision scaling. Consequently, users may receive fewer tokens than they should, leading to significant financial discrepancies.

### Root Cause


In the following code from the [getCreateAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L333) and [getRedeemAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L512) functions:

```solidity
creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply; // Not scaled by PRECISION - ❌

redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply); // Not scaled by PRECISION - ❌
```

The `create/redeem` rates for `TokenType.BOND` and `TokenType.LEVERAGE` tokens are calculated without scalling by PRECISION. This leads to imprecise results because other calculations in the contract correctly include the PRECISION factor, ensuring proper scaling. 

**For example:**

> 1. **uint256 creationRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;**
> 2. **creationRate = (adjustedValue * PRECISION) / assetSupply;**

> 3. **redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;**
> 4. **redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;**

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Wrong calculation; not an attack.

### Impact

The absence of **PRECISION scaling** in the `creationRate` and `redeemRate` calculations causes underestimation of token values, leading to reduced creation and redemption rates for users. This discrepancy may result in a fewer tokens issued/redeemed than intended. 


### PoC



1. **cbETH = 365601588897**  
   - Price of the cbETH/USD token from the Chainlink feed.  

2. **poolReserves = 1e18**  
   - Represents the reserves in the pool.  

3. **oracleDecimals = 8**  
   - Number of decimals for the oracle's precision.  


### TVL Calculation  

```solidity
uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
```

- **Calculation Breakdown**:  
  `ethPrice * poolReserves = 365601588897 * 1e18 = 365601588897000000000000000000`  
  `tvl = 365601588897000000000000000000 / (10 ** 8) = 3656015888970000000000`  

- **Result**:  
  `tvl = 3656015888970000000000 (total value locked).`


### Multiplier and Asset Supply  

- **Multiplier**:  
  - **800,000 (80%)** for **BOND**  
  - **200,000 (20%)** for **LEVERAGE**  

- **Asset Supply**:  
  `100e18` for **BOND** or **LEVERAGE**.  


### Conditional Pricing Logic  

1. **If Collateral Level > 1.2**:  
   - **Creation Price** = Fixed at **100 USDC** per bondETH.  

2. **If Collateral Level ≤ 1.2**:  
   - **Redemption Price** = Adjusts to **20% of the vault’s collateral value per levETH** or the market price, whichever is lower.  


### Creation and Redemption Rate Calculations  

#### Creation Rate  

```solidity
creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply; // Not scaled by PRECISION
```

- Calculation:  
  `(3656015888970000000000 * 800000) / 100e18`  
  `= 29248127.11176 bondETH`  

- **Solidity Result**:  
  `29248127`  


#### Redemption Rate  

```solidity
redeemRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply; // Not scaled by PRECISION
```

- Calculation:  
  `(3656015888970000000000 * 200000) / 100e18`  
  `= 7312031.77794 levETH`  

- **Solidity Result**:  
  `7312031`  


### Observations  

In both **creation** and **redemption** rate calculations, there are precisions that are not considered due to the lack of scaling by `PRECISION`. This might result in slight inaccuracies integer values.  

### Mitigation


Add **PRECISION scaling** to the `creationRate` and `redeemRate` calculations to ensure accurate token values.
