# The pool contract will be drained by the attacker due to incorrect multiplier settings.

## Summary

The pool contract implements `getCreateAmount` and `getRedeemAmount` to calculate the amount that can be obtained at each buy and sale. However, due to improper implementation, this can be exploited by attackers to steal funds.

## Vulnerability Details

In `getCreateAmount`, when collateralLevel is less than COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD, the price of BOND_TOKEN will become lower, which is calculated by these two lines of code:

```solidity
creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;
return ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
```

For a simple example, tvl = 12000$ (4 ETH), multiplier = 0.8, assetSupply(bondSupply) = 100, BOND_TARGET_PRICE = 100$ (At this time, COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD is exactly equal to 1.2). The user makes a purchase using $1000 worth of ETH. So the creationRate = 12000 * 0.8 / 100 = 96$, which is not 100$. This looks a bit strange, doesn't itï¼ŸBecause in the border case of collateralLevel=COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD, the price drops a lot instantly. In a reasonable implementation, it should be 100$ still. In any case, the amount of BONK_TOKEN that users can obtain at this time is 1000/96 = 10.4.

We now assume that the user already has 3 BOND_TOKEN before. That is, the total amount is 13.4 and the cost is 1300$.

Let's see what happens if the user simply throws away these purchased BOND_TOKEN.

In the function `getRedeemAmount`, the collateralLevel will be (13000 -  13.4*100) / ((110.4 - 13.4) * 100) = 1.202 > 120%. Therefore, the redeemed price at this time is the market price, which is 11000 / 110.4 = 99.63$ and user will obtain 99.63 * 13.4 = 1335$ which is more than 1300$.

## Impact

Users can steal funds from the contract by purchasing and redeeming them.

Manual code review

## Recommendations

I think the root cause here lies in the multiplier setting. In the contract, for BOND_TOKEN, its multiplier is 0.8. This results in multiplier * COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD = 0.96, not 1. The correct multiplier should be equal to 1/1.2 = 0.83.
