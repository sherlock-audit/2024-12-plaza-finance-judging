# Discrepancy between spec and code: redemption of levETH

### Summary

An incorrect `redeemRate` value in `getRedeemAmount()` ([Pool.sol#L519-L520](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L519-L520)) will cause an incorrect redemption price for `levETH` holders, potentially leading to a financial loss for them as the protocol will incorrectly calculate the amount of reserve tokens to return upon redemption.

### Root Cause

In `Pool.sol`'s `getRedeemAmount()` function, the `redeemRate` calculation for `levETH` deviates from the documented specification.

When the collateral level is greater than 1.2, the [documentation](https://convexitylabs.notion.site/Redeem-Sell-12f3b6744d76814c8cc8f7619d68d377) specifies the following redemption price calculation:

> Redemption Price = (Total Value of ETH related tokens in the Vault - (100 × Quantity of bondETH outstanding)) ÷ (Quantity of levETH outstanding)

However, the code ([Pool.sol#L519-L520](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L519-L520)) introduces a check against the `marketRate` at the end of the function both for `BOND` and `LEVERAGE` token.

This allows the `marketRate` of `bondToken` to potentially lower the `redeemRate` of `levETH`, contradicting the specification. This `marketRate` check should not apply to `levETH` when the collateral level is above 1.2.

When the collateral level is less than or equal to 1.2, the documentation states:

> Adjusts to 20% of the vault’s collateral value per levETH or the market price, whichever is lower

The ambiguity here lies in which "market price" is being referred to: the market price of `bondToken` or the market price of `levETH`. The code currently uses the `marketRate` of `bondToken`. However, given that `levETH` represents leveraged exposure to the reserve token, it's unclear why the `bondToken`'s market price would be relevant in this scenario.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  The collateral level must be greater than 1.2.
2.  The `marketRate` of `bondToken` must be lower than the calculated `redeemRate` based on the `levETH` redemption formula.
3. A user must initiate a redeem transaction for `levETH`.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. The collateral level is greater than 1.2.
2. The `marketRate` of `bondToken` falls below the `redeemRate` that would be calculated based on the `levETH` redemption formula.
3. A user calls the `redeem()` function to redeem their `levETH`.
4. The protocol uses the lower `marketRate` of `bondToken` instead of the correct `redeemRate` calculated according to the `levETH` formula, returning fewer reserve tokens to the user than they are entitled to.

### Impact

`levETH` holders cannot redeem their tokens for the correct amount of underlying assets as specified in the documentation. This discrepancy can lead to a financial loss for `levETH` holders.

N/A

### Mitigation

The specification should be clarified, and the code adjusted accordingly.
