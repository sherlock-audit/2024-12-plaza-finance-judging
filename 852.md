# `redeemRate` is of doubtful accuracy when redeem reserve tokens with leverage tokens

### Summary

When users redeem reserve tokens with leverage tokens under the condition that `collateralLevel` is above the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, the value of `redeemRate` is smaller than the expected value. 

### Root Cause

[function getRedeemAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L513C1-L514C89)
```solidity
  function getRedeemAmount(
    TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 bondSupply,
    uint256 levSupply,
    uint256 poolReserves,
    uint256 ethPrice,
    uint8 oracleDecimals,
    uint256 marketRate
  ) public pure returns(uint256) {
    ...
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
    ...
  }
```
As you can see, in this function during the calculation of `redeemRate`, it divided by `assetSupply` first and then multiple `PRECISION`. Of course, because of this, the value of `redeemRate` is smaller than an expected value. Thus, it is smaller than a value of `redeemRate` that multiple `PRECISION` before dividing. It occurs loss of reserve amount that the user receives.

### Mitigation

```solidity
  function getRedeemAmount(
    TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 bondSupply,
    uint256 levSupply,
    uint256 poolReserves,
    uint256 ethPrice,
    uint8 oracleDecimals,
    uint256 marketRate
  ) public pure returns(uint256) {
    ...
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
-     redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
+     redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / assetSupply;
    ...
  }
