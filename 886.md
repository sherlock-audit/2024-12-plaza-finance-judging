# Users can redeem more than permitted by manipulating the `collateralLevel` from `< 120%` to `> 120%` through donations.

### Summary

The calculation of the pool's `TVL` is based on `balanceOf`. As a result, donations can increase the `TVL`, which in turn can affect the `collateralLevel`.

When redeeming `BondToken`, the redemption amount is determined by the `collateralLevel`. The calculation of the redemption amount varies depending on whether the `collateralLevel` is above or below `120%`.

Therefore, malicious redeemers can obtain more underlying assets than they are entitled to by manipulating the `collateralLevel` through donations.

### Root Cause

The [simulateRedeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L429) function calculates the redemption amount based on `poolReserves`, which is determined by `balanceOf`.

Consequently, donations can alter this value. Since the `collateralLevel` is determined by `poolReserves`, donations can also modify the `collateralLevel`.

```solidity
      function simulateRedeem(TokenType tokenType, uint256 depositAmount) public view returns(uint256) {
        ...

429     uint256 poolReserves = IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this))
                              .normalizeTokenAmount(reserveToken, COMMON_DECIMALS);

        ...

        return getRedeemAmount(
          tokenType,
          depositAmount,
          bondSupply,
          levSupply,
458       poolReserves,
          getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD),
          getOracleDecimals(reserveToken, USD)
        ).normalizeAmount(COMMON_DECIMALS, IERC20(reserveToken).safeDecimals());
      }
```

The [getRedeemAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L477-L525) function calculates the `redeemRate` based on whether the `collateralLevel` is above or below `120%`.

Malicious users can manipulate the `collateralLevel`, enabling them to redeem at a higher rate than they should be entitled to.

```solidity
      function getRedeemAmount(
        ...
        
        uint256 collateralLevel;
        if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND) {
498       collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
        ...
        
        uint256 redeemRate;
511     if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
          redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
        } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
          redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
515     } else {
          redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
        }
        
        ...
      }
```

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

- Current State of the Pool:
    - `bondSupply`: 10
    - `TVL`: 1100
- Bob wants to redeem 5 `BondToken`:
    - `collaterlLevel`: (1100 - 100 * 5) / (10 - 5) = 120% (see line 498)
    - As `collateralLevel <= 120%`, he can redeem at price of: `1100 * 0.8 / 10 = 88` (see the case of line 511)
    - As a result, his expected redeem amount: `88 * 5 = 440`

- However, Bob donates 1:
    - `bondSupply`: 10
    - `TVL`: 1100 + 1 = 1101
    - `collaterlLevel`: (1101 - 100 * 5) / (10 - 5) = 120.2% (see line 498)
    - `redeemRate`: 100 (see the case of line 515)
    - `redeemAmount`: 5 * 100 = 500

As you can see, Bob was initially able to redeem only `440`. However, by donating `1`, he can increase his redemption to `500`. Thus, he can profit by `500 - 1 - 440 = 59`.

### Impact

Redeemers can obtain more than they are entitled to by manipulating the `collateralLevel` through donations.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Implement a state variable to accurately track the actual `TVL`.
