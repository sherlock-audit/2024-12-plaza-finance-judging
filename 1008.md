# Fee Calculation On Required Collateral Undermines BondETH Backing Guarantees

## Summary
A critical vulnerability exists in the Pool contract's fee calculation mechanism that could drain essential collateral needed to back bondETH obligations. The fee is incorrectly calculated on the entire pool balance without excluding the portion required as collateral for bondETH, which could lead to system insolvency.

## Vulnerability Details

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L718

```solidity
function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * 
           (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
}
```
This calculation violates the protocol's core requirement that each bondETH token must maintain BOND_TARGET_PRICE (100 USDC) worth of backing.

## Impact
The fee calculation's impact manifests through its collection on the entire pool balance, including collateral required for bondETH backing. For a concrete example, in a pool with 1000 ETH where 800 ETH is needed to maintain the bondETH 100 USDC/token backing requirement, the 10% annual fee would extract 100 ETH - including from the portion meant to secure bond obligations. This directly erodes the protocol's core collateralization requirement.

The erosion triggers a compounding negative feedback loop in the protocol mechanics. As backing per bondETH falls below the 100 USDC target, the protocol must sell progressively larger amounts of ETH through auctions to maintain coupon payments. This increased selling reduces the pool's collateral base, which in turn means future fee calculations consume a larger percentage of the remaining backing. The cycle continues with each fee collection and auction, steadily undermining the core protocol invariant that bondETH must maintain 100 USDC worth of backing per token.

## Proof of Concept 
Consider this scenario using protocol constants:
```solidity
// BOND_TARGET_PRICE = 100 (fixed USDC backing per bond)
// Max fee = 100000 (10% annually with PRECISION = 1000000)
```
With a pool containing:

1. 1000 ETH total balance
2. 800 ETH required as bondETH backing (8000 bondETH tokens at BOND_TARGET_PRICE)
3. Annual fee of 10% (maximum allowed)
4. After one year:
- Current: Fee = 1000 ETH * 10% = 100 ETH
- Should be: Fee = (1000 - 800) ETH * 10% = 20 ETH

5. Difference of 80 ETH incorrectly taken from required backing, reducing bondETH backing below BOND_TARGET_PRICE

## Recommended Mitigation
Modify `getFeeAmount()` to exclude required bondETH backing:

```solidity
function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalBalance = IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 bondBackingRequired = bondToken.totalSupply() * 
                                 BOND_TARGET_PRICE / 
                                 getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD);
    uint256 feeBasis = totalBalance - bondBackingRequired;
    return (feeBasis * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / 
           (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
}
```

This ensures fees are only collected on the portion of the pool not required for bondETH backing.
