# Bidding may be blocked if a previous bidder is blacklisted by USDC

### Summary

Removal of the lowest bid from the auction queue may revert and block new bidders from bidding with the higher price or higher amount in case a bid to remove belongs to a user blacklisted by the USDC token contract.

### Root Cause

In Action.sol:161
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L160-L161

`removeExcessBids()` function is called after adding a new bid. In case of `currentCouponAmount` being higher than `totalBuyCouponAmount`, it tries to remove the lowest bid or reduce its size:

The problem is that it tries to send the refunded amount of coupon tokens back to the bidder. Because the coupon token is likely to be USDC (or other stablecoins with blacklist functionality), it will revert if the USDC contract has added the bidder address into blacklist.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction accumulated more coupon token amount than `totalBuyCouponAmount` or the number of bids exceeds the pre-configured maximum.

### External Pre-conditions

1. USDC token contract blacklisted the bidder of the lowest bid

### Attack Path

One of the possible attack paths involving an adversary actor could be this:
1. An attacker deposits the `totalBuyCouponAmount` amount of USDC and bids to buy ETH up to the limit (90% of the pool)
2. USDC owner blocklists attacker because their assets are from other hacks proceeds (https://basescan.org/address/0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913#writeProxyContract#F2)
3. No one can remove the attacker's bid now because the USDC transfer reverts
4. An attacker ends the auction after it expires
5. An attacker can claim his bid and get ETH even though the clearing price will be unfairly low and thus drain the pool.

Please note that the malicious intent of the bidder is not required for this issue to manifest itself. It could happen just because any bidder can potentially be blacklisted by the USDC contract.

### Impact

* Users who want to bid with a higher price will not be able to do that.
* Auction may end up with a very low clearing price of reserve tokens and therefore lose excess of reserve tokens, in extreme cases up to `poolSaleLimit` (90% or more percent of total reserves).

### Mitigation

Do not refund bids, instead use pull over push pattern
