# Auction Doesn't Work Well Due To Lack Of Validation

### Summary

User could grief the auction by bid with huge value of buyReserveAmount and this will not let the auction ended successfully.


### Root Cause

Because of `totalSellReserveAmount` not exceed `poolSaleLimit` validation, only in the end of the auction rather than in the start when user wants to bid. There is a high probability that the auction could occur a `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` state after the auction ended, since totalSellReserveAmount that's being added every time user bids has no maximum value.

```solidity
function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
        if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

        if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
            state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
@>      } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
            state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
        } else {
        _;
    }
```

User also could bid with very low sellCouponAmount as long as it evenly divides by slotSize. Besides that, user could also bid with 1e50(MAX_BID_AMOUNT) of buyReserveAmount.
```solidity
    function bid(
        uint256 buyReserveAmount,
        uint256 sellCouponAmount
    ) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
@>  if (sellCouponAmount == 0 || sellCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount)
            revert InvalidSellAmount();
        if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0) revert InvalidSellAmount();
        if (buyReserveAmount == 0) revert BidAmountTooLow();
@>  if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh();

        _;

        currentCouponAmount += sellCouponAmount;
        totalSellReserveAmount += buyReserveAmount;

        _;
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. The pool's exist and the reserveToken balance of Pool contract is there.
2. There is an auctions with x duration and 1000 maxBids(Pool::startAuction).
3. The attacker will bid with smallest amount of `sellCouponAmount` and super big amount of `buyReserveAmount` that the `totalSellReserveAmount` will exceed `poolSaleLimit` with the lowest ratio in the list.
4. Since there is 1000 slot to be filled, then there will always big possibilities where the list of bid's slot doesn't fulfilled.
5. At the end, the auction will be stated as `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`.
6. The auction will always be failed.
7. User called `Auction::claimRefund` to took his money back.

### Impact

Most auctions are likely to fail due to griefing, as there's a high chance that the list of bids will not meet the required maxBids. When an auction fails, the pool cannot sell a portion of its assets such as wstETH in exchange for USDC to distribute to bondETH holders during each coupon distribution. This leads to losses for bondETH holders, as the distribution amount is reduced. Additionally, they must wait for the distribution period to end before creating a new auction, which is also likely to be griefed.

### Mitigation

1. Make a minimum ratio validation to avoid griefing with very small ratio.
