# A Malicious User can ensure some auctions fails

### Summary

the `Auction.totalSellReserveAmount` increases with every bid, which means it is manipulatable by bidders.
A Malicious User can bid with multiple account to insure the `totalSellReserveAmount` get bigger than the `sellReserveToken ` balance of that pool,
which lead the auction to be marked as `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` in the `endAuction()`:

### Root Cause

the choice to rely on `totalSellReserveAmount` to update the state of an auction in `endAuction()` isn't a good idea since that value is manipulatable by bidders.
```solidity
  function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns(uint256) {
    if (sellCouponAmount == 0 || sellCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (buyReserveAmount == 0) revert BidAmountTooLow();
    if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh();

    // Transfer buy tokens to contract
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sellCouponAmount);

    Bid memory newBid = Bid({
      bidder: msg.sender,
      buyReserveAmount: buyReserveAmount,
      sellCouponAmount: sellCouponAmount,
      nextBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the end of the list
      prevBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the start of the list
      claimed: false
    });

    lastBidIndex++; // Avoids 0 index
    uint256 newBidIndex = lastBidIndex;
    bids[newBidIndex] = newBid;
    bidCount++;

    // Insert the new bid into the sorted linked list
    insertSortedBid(newBidIndex);
    currentCouponAmount += sellCouponAmount;
    totalSellReserveAmount += buyReserveAmount;

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool)` needs to be reachable (not very high) for that to happen

note: The Malicious user can check the balance of reserve for that pool using the `IERC20.balanceOf()` view function 

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user calls `bid()` with multiple addresses making a very high bids ensuring the Auction will fail.
2. After that he simply calls `claimRefund()` ad get his funds back.

### Impact

The Pools owners will be suffering to sell their reserve which is bad for the Protocol reputation.

### Mitigation

I am not sure what is the solution here since this is a design choice, consider checking `totalSellReserveAmount` doesn't reaches the balance of the pool with every bid.
