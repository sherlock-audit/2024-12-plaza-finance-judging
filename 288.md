# User will spend the same amount to create bondETH regardless of whether the collateral value is less than, equal to, or greater than 1.2.

### Summary

Missing check for bondETH creation if the collateral value is less than or equal to 1.2; it just uses the creation rate for when the collateral value is greater than 1.2 every time. Hence, the user pays more than they are meant to for creating bondETH when the pool is undercollateralized.

This line sets the `creationRate` for when the collateral value is > 1.2 : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L327 

This block of code lacks checks to handle the `creationRate` of bondETH when the collateral level is <= 1.2
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L329-L341

### Root Cause

In `Pool.sol`, there is a missing check for the calculation of the `creationRate` of bondETH when the collateral value is <= 1.2
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L329-L341

### Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol has to be undercollateralized (collateral level <= 1.2)

### Attack Path

By trying to create a new bondETH derivative when the protocol is undercollateralized,the user gets to pay more which results in a griefing attack.

### Impact

User has to pay excess than what they should pay

### Mitigation

```diff
 if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
+  if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND) {
+    creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / bondSupply;
+   }
      
      if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }
      creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;
  }
```
