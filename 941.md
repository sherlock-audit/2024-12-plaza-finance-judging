# NotInAuction() modifier allows pass no matter if its in Auction or not

### Summary

There is always no Auction for the current Period of the bond token, as the current period is incremented as soon as an Auction is assigned at its place.

Current period is given Auction and set

The Current period is incremented

Makes sure that there are no new Auctions now at this current Period




This allows `setDistributionPeriod`, `setAuctionPeriod` and `setSharesPerToken` to be set even during an Auction.

Changing these during the Auction will affect the protocol in that there can be simultaneous Auctions as the `setDistributionPeriod` can be altered even during an Auction bypassing important restrictions in starting the Auction.

### Root Cause

The notInAuction modifier doesn't work as it should

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol may set configs during the Auction leading to erratic behavior.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
  modifier NotInAuction() {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
-    require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0), AuctionIsOngoing());
+   require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod < block.timestamp, AuctionIsOngoing() );
    _;
  }
```
