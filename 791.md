# In the create() and redeem() functions, the lastFeeClaimTime is not updated, which leads to incorrect fee calculations.





## Summary
During the create() and redeem() processes, the number of reserveToken in the pool changes, but the lastFeeClaimTime and claimFees are not updated, which results in incorrect fee calculations.


## Root Cause

```javascript
  function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
    require(msg.sender == feeBeneficiary || poolFactory.hasRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE(), msg.sender), NotBeneficiary());
@>    uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();
    
    if (feeAmount == 0) {
      revert NoFeesToClaim();
    }
    
    lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
    
    emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
  }

  /**
   * @dev Returns the amount of fees to be claimed.
   * @return The amount of fees to be claimed.
   */
  function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
@>    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }
```
The getFeeAmount() function calculates the fee based on the current number of reserveToken in the pool. However, during the create() and redeem() processes, the number of reserveToken in the pool changes. Since lastFeeClaimTime is not updated, this causes incorrect fee calculations in the end.


## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path
For example:
After the pool is created for one month, the user calls create() with 1e18 reserveToken.
Then, they call claimFees(),
fee = 1e18 * fee * 1 month.
However, the 1e18 reserveToken just deposited should have a fee of 0.

The same issue occurs with redeem().

## Impact
This leads to incorrect fee calculations for either the user or the protocol, resulting in financial losses for either the user or the protocol.

## PoC




## Mitigation
In the create() and redeem() functions, claimFees() is called internally, which updates the lastFeeClaimTime and settles the fees from before.
