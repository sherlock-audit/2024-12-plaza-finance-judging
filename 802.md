# Coupon Token may remain permanently stuck in the `Pool` contract if not distributed to the `Distributor` contract

### Summary

The coupon token can only be distributed to the `Distributor` contract with the coupon amount from the most recent auction via the `Pool::distribute` function. This creates a potential issue if the `Pool::distribute` function is not called in a timely manner, especially if it is not executed before the start of a new auction period.

### Root Cause


After each auction period ends, the only way to transfer coupon tokens from the `Pool` contract to the `Distributor` contract is by calling the `Pool::distribute` function.

However, the duration of each auction period is not enforced to have a minimum value. This means auction periods can be extremely short, increasing the likelihood that coupon tokens will not be distributed from the `Pool` to the `Distributor` contract in time.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Two scenarios can lead to this issue where coupon tokens are not distributed:
1, The `Pool::distribute` function is not called before the start of the next distribution period.
2, Base chain downtime prevents the `Pool::distribute` function from being executed before the start of the next distribution period.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1, Suppose the current distribution period is 10. When period 11 begins, a user can call `Pool::distribute` to distribute the coupon token amount from the auction in period 10 to the `Distributor` contract.
2, During distribution period 11, Base chain downtime might occur, preventing the execution of `Pool::distribute` within period 11.
3, When distribution period 12 begins, a user calls `Pool::distribute`. However, this call will only distribute the coupon token amount from the auction in period 11 to the `Distributor` contract. The coupon token amount from period 10 remains stuck in the Pool contract, despite it also needing to be distributed.



### Impact

Chain downtimes are a known occurrence. For instance:
- The Base network experienced a [45-minute downtime in September 2023](https://bsc.news/post/base-networks-first-major-outage-what-happened-and-what-it-means-for-users).
- On Layer 2 in general, such as Polygon zkEVM, the impact can be even more severe, with the network going down for [10 hours](https://unchainedcrypto.com/polygon-zkevm-chain-goes-down-for-10-hours/).

These scenarios can cause coupon amounts from previous auctions to remain permanently stuck in the `Pool` contract, resulting in bond token holders not receiving the rewards they are entitled to.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

Introduce a new variable, `lastPeriodDistributed`, to track the last period successfully distributed to the `Distributor` contract. This allows the system to identify which distribution periods have not yet been processed, ensuring that no rewards are left undistributed.
