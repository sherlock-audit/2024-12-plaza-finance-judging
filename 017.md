# USDC Blacklisted address can DoS new bid in `Auction.sol`

### Summary

User can place new bid by calling `Auction::bid` function. If the new bids and the amount of bids exceed the `maxBids` amount, the lowest bids would be removed from the `bids` mapping, but this can be DoS'ed if there are blacklisted address among the soon to be removed `bids`. Preventing the new bids to be applied to the contract state.

### Root Cause

In `Auction::_removeBids` and `Auction::removeExcessBids` the out of range bids would be refunded.

[`Auction::_removeBid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L298-L331):
```solidity
  function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
.
.
.
.
    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
@>  IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);

    emit BidRemoved(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);

    delete bids[bidIndex];
    bidCount--;
  }
```

[`Auction::removeExcessBids`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L250-L292):
```solidity
  function removeExcessBids() internal {
.
.
.
    while (currentIndex != 0 && amountToRemove != 0) {
.
.
.
        // Remove the bid
@>      _removeBid(currentIndex);

        // Move to the previous bid (higher price)
        currentIndex = prevIndex;
      } else {
.
.
.       
        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
@>      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
        
        amountToRemove = 0;
        emit BidReduced(currentIndex, currentBid.bidder, currentBid.buyReserveAmount, currentBid.sellCouponAmount);
      }
    }
  }
```

Given the `buyCouponToken` can be USDC, this would be potentially be DoS'ed if there are blacklisted address inside the one who would be refunded.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. maxBids = 10
2. User A bids 100 USDC for 1 underlying asset token
3. User A blacklisted by USDC
4. Other 9 user bid > 100 USDC for 1 underlying asset token
5. User B bids 200 USDC for 1 underlying asset token > transaction revert

### Impact

Potential DoS of `Auction::bid` function

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

makes the refund claimable by user, this would prevent such edge cases and generally more safer than directly send the refund to bidder.
