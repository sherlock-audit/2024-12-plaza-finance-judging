# Auction date will drift irreversibly forward over time leading to loss of yield for bond holders

### Summary

During the creation of the auction, lastDistribution is set to block.timestamp. Delays are compounding and will lead to loss of yield over time as the subsequent distribution will be delayed.

[Pool.sol#L530-L571](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530-L571)

        function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
            // Check if distribution period has passed
    @>      require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod < block.timestamp, DistributionPeriodNotPassed());

            // Check if auction period hasn't passed
            require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());

            ... SNIP

            // Update last distribution time
    @>      lastDistribution = block.timestamp;
        }

Above we see that lastDistribution is used to determine if the auction can be started. Additionally, lastDistribution is set to block.timestamp which means that any delay between lastDistribution + distributionPeriod and block.timestamp will cause loss of yield in the subsequent quarter.

According to sherlock rules a loss of 0.01% qualifies as medium impact. The distribution period is 1 quarter or 90 days which is 7 776 000 seconds. This means that a delay of 777.6 seconds (13 minutes) will break this threshold. Given that the start of the auction is expected to be within lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod it is reasonable to assume that in real world conditions that a delay of this magnitude can and will happen.

### Root Cause

[Pool.sol#L570](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L570) sets lastDistribution == block.timestamp

### Internal preconditions

None

### External preconditions

startAuction is delayed by at least 777.6 seconds

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Loss of yield for bond holders

### POC

N/A

### Mitigation

Instead of setting lastDistribution to `block.timestamp` is should be set to `lastDistribution + distributionPeriod`
