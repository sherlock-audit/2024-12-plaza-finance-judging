# Pool reserve can be insufficient for auction or protocol fee

### Summary

Lack of constraints between pool sale limit and protocol fee can cause the Pool reserve to be insufficient for either the auction settlement or the protocol fee

### Root Cause

The function [`Auction::endAuction()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336-L350) can end and settle the auction. The auction can be succeeded if total buy coupon amount reached and the sale limit is not exceeded. In the event of auction succeeded, reserve tokens are sent from Pool contract to Auction contract. Indeed, the reserve token balance of Pool contract includes protocol fees.
```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
@>      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
@>      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

In Pool contract, the setting `poolSaleLimit` can be set to be not under 90%, and `fee` can be set to be under 10%. 
The problem arises when there is no constraints between `poolSaleLimit` and `fee` such that if `poolSaleLimit + fee > 100%` (for example, `poolSaleLimit = 100%` and `fee = 5%`), the auction settlement can cause the Pool to be insufficient for either Auction settlement OR protocol fee.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Pool sale limit is set to 100% and fee is set to 5%
2. An auction started
3. Auction ended with sale up to 99% 
4. Protocol calls to collect protocol fee
5. The auction settlement failed because 5% of pool reserve is taken


### Impact

- Functionality broken: Unable to handle payment

### PoC

### Mitigation

Constraint between pool sale limit and protocol fee
