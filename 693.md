# Token Transfer Exploit via Overriding `Pool::transferReserveToAuction`

### Summary

The `Pool::transferReserveToAuction` function in the Pool contract is marked as virtual, allowing it to be overridden in child contracts. This setup can be exploited if an attacker manages to deploy a contract that overrides this function to transfer reserve tokens directly to the attacker's address without proper authorization or checks.

### Root Cause

In [`Pool.sol::`L577-L583](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L577-L583) , `transferReserveToAuctiuon` function is marked as virtual. This means a user can create a malicious contract that implements `transferReserveToAuction` using `safeTransferFrom` to transfer reserve tokens from other user's reserves.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Use `safeTransferFrom` to transfer from the reserve pool or from other users' reserves

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
-- function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
++ function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```
