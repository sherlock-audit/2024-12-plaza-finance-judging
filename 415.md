# Failed pool creation locks user funds

#### 1. Brief
The `createPool` function in `PreDeposit.sol` does not handle failures in the pool creation process, potentially locking user funds if the factory contract fails silently or returns an invalid pool address.  

#### 2. Description  
**Mechanism**:  
- The `createPool` function calls `factory.createPool(...)` to deploy a new pool.  
- If the factory fails to create the pool **but does not revert** (e.g., returns `address(0)` or an invalid pool), the `poolCreated` flag is still set to `true`.  

**Flaw**:  
- The current implementation assumes `factory.createPool()` will always revert on failure. However, if the factory:  
  1. Returns an invalid pool address (e.g., due to a logic error).  
  2. Fails silently (e.g., due to misconfiguration),  
  the `poolCreated` state is still updated to `true`, blocking retries and locking funds.  

**Example Attack Flow**:  
1. User deposits funds into `PreDeposit`.  
2. `createPool` is called, but `factory.createPool()` returns `address(0)` due to a bug.  
3. `poolCreated` is set to `true`, but no valid pool exists.  
4. Users cannot retry `createPool`, and funds remain permanently stuck.  

#### 3. Impact
- **Direct Impact**: User funds are irreversibly locked in the contract.  
- **Protocol Impact**: Loss of user trust and legal/regulatory risks.  

#### 4. Proof of Concept (PoC) 
**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Deploy a faulty [PoolFactory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PoolFactory.sol#L124-L240) that returns `address(0)` for `createPool()`.  
2. Call `PreDeposit.createPool()`. Observe that `pool` is set to `address(0)`, but `poolCreated = true`.  
3. Attempt to retry `createPool()`; transaction reverts with `PoolAlreadyCreated`.  

**Code Snippet (Vulnerable Logic)**:  
```solidity
function createPool() external {
    // ... checks ...
    pool = factory.createPool(...); // Returns address(0) on failure
    emit PoolCreated(pool, ...);
    poolCreated = true; // Irreversibly set even if pool is invalid
}
```

#### 5. Mitigation Steps
1. **Use `try/catch` for Error Handling**:  
   Wrap the factory call in a `try/catch` block to handle failures gracefully.  
2. **Validate Pool Address**:  
   Add checks to ensure the returned pool address is valid.
