# BalancerRouter retains unused assets from maxAmountsIn, potentially causing user fund losses

### Summary

When users use BalancerRouter to join a pool via the `joinBalancerPool` function, any unused amounts from the maxAmountsIn array are not refunded to the user. This can cause unnecessary retention of user funds within the contract.

### Root Cause

In the BalancerRouter the function `joinBalancerPool` is as such

In the BalancerRouter function joinBalancerPool, users transfer maxAmountsIn[i] of assets[i] to the BalancerRouter contract. However, not all transferred tokens may be used when joining the Balancer V2 pool. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. BalancerRouter is deployed and users are advised to use the router, for uses cases like to deposit funds into the `PreDeposit` contract.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Valid BalancerV2 Vault and BalancerPool used to when deploying `BalancerRouter` contract.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` with the desired `maxAmountsIn` of each asset on `BalancerRouter` contract.
2. BalancerRouter calls `joinPool` and `BalancerVault` and receives BPT Tokens.
3. BalancerRouter calls `deposit` on `PreDeposit` contract, completing the transaction.
4. Any unspent amount of assets remain on the `BalancerRouter` contract without being refunded back to user.

### Impact

The unused tokens remain in the BalancerRouter contract without being refunded to the users.
