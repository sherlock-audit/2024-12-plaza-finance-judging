# Auction can be failed repeatedly reliably by an Attacker by bidding high reserve amount

### Summary

The Auction final state can be made to fail by bidding for reserve amount higher than the pool Sale limit.

The bidder would have to match the pool's reserves in USDC and have a good sell:buy ratio but would get 100% of his/her attack investment back, which would enable the attacker to repeat the process without worry.

### Root Cause

The Auction contract allows for bids surpassing `totalSellReserveAmount` while it doesn't allow bids surpassing `totalBuyCouponAmount`. Even though the Auction fails when `totalSellReserveAmount` is higher than the pool sale limit. 

There are no safe-guards in the protocol against this scenario.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker looks at the Auction `totalSellReserveAmount` and current Auction's pool balance
2. Attacker makes a bid with a high enough sell - buy ratio for the Auction such that the `totalSellReserveAmount` becomes higher than the pool sale limit for the Auction
3. Auction fails
4. Attacker gets his bid refunded. 

### Impact

The Attacker fails the Auction result state from being SUCCESS.

### PoC

### Mitigation

`removeExcessBids` for excess Reserve amount sold.
