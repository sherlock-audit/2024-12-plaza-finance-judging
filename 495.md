# Auction Price Manipulation via Incremental Bid Flooding To Reach `maxBids`

### Summary

The attacker could win the auction at an unfairly low price, even though other legitimate participants are bidding higher, by flooding the auction with small incremental bids that push the price higher without truly increasing the value of the asset to reach the `maxBids` limit. This can result in unfair auction outcomes where the attacker wins with a low bid since no one can bid anymore.

### Root Cause

[`Auction.sol:125-171`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125-171) The issue arises when the auction contract does not have a sufficient mechanism to handle incremental bidding that is not in good faith. The attacker can monitor the auction and place very small bids (just higher than the current highest bid) *at the last minute or when the maxBids is almost reached*, which may push the price higher, but with no real intent to participate meaningfully, thus taking advantage of the auction’s bid-limiting system that only cares about the highest bid without considering the quality of that bid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The auction must allow multiple bids per participant, with the auction price being based on the highest bid.
The contract may be vulnerable to bid flooding where small incremental bids are allowed.

### External Pre-conditions

The attacker needs to be able to monitor the mempool and know when bids are nearing the maximum bid count (maxBids).
The attacker must be able to submit bids just before the limit is reached, potentially on the last slot where there is only one slot left.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker Monitors Auction: The attacker monitors the auction and sees that the price is gradually increasing but also notices that only a few slots are remaining before the maxBids limit is reached.

2. Flooding with Small Incremental Bids: As the auction nears its maximum bid limit (maxBids), the attacker places a series of very small bids that are just slightly higher than the previous highest bid (for example, 0.01 ETH more than the last bid).

3. Max Bid Limit Reached: The auction hits its maxBids limit, and no more legitimate bids can be placed. Since the attacker flooded the auction with these small bids, they are able to outbid everyone with a minimal increase in their bid amount.

4. Attacker Wins with a Low Bid: The attacker wins the auction with a bid that is only marginally higher than the last legitimate bid, even though the auction value has been pushed higher through many of their incremental bids.

5. Legitimate Bidders Blocked: Due to the maxBids limit, legitimate bidders are unable to place higher bids, and the attacker secures the auction at an unfair price.

### Impact

1. Legitimate Bidders are unable to participate effectively in the auction, as the auction slots are filled by incremental, low-value bids.
2. Assets can be sold at a price much lower than expected, since the attacker’s strategy allows them to outbid others with minimal effort.
3. Unfair Auction Outcome: The auction is manipulated, with the attacker winning by placing many low-value incremental bids at the right time.

### PoC

```solidity
function testAuctionSnipingAttack() public {
    // Setup bidders
    address legitimateBidder = address(0x11111111);
    address attacker = address(0x22222222);
    uint256 slot = auction.slotSize();
    
    // Give tokens to both bidders
    usdc.mint(legitimateBidder, 2000 ether);
    usdc.mint(attacker, 1000 ether);

    // Legitimate bidder places an early bid
    vm.startPrank(legitimateBidder);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(50 ether, slot); // Legitimate bid at start
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Skip time to 9 days, 23 hours, and 55 minutes (5 minutes before auction end)
    skip(9 days + 23 hours + 55 minutes);

    // Attacker places a bid in the last second
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(55 ether, slot); // Last-minute bid to snipe the auction
    vm.stopPrank();

    skip(5 minutes);

    vm.startPrank(legitimateBidder);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    vm.expectRevert();
    auction.bid(60 ether, slot); // Legitimate bid at start
    vm.stopPrank();

    assertEq(auction.bidCount(), 2, "Only two bids should have been placed");
  }

```
