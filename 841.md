# Funds might remain locked in `BalancerRouter` when depositing in Balancer pool

### Summary

Not checking how much of the deposited assets are actually deposited in the pool, will lead to loss of funds for the user, because the remaining assets will be locked inside the `BalancerRouter`.

### Root Cause

`BalancerRouter` provides an integration with Balancer V2 pools via the [joinBalancerPool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L65), which is used by  [joinBalancerAndPlaza()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L42) and [joinBalancerAndPredeposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L23). When called, [joinBalancerPool()]() accepts the `poolId`, array of assets, the maximum amounts the user is willing to deposit and additional user data. First it transfers the maximum amount of assets from the user's address to its ([ref](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L72-L75)). And after that joins the pool ([ref](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L86)). 

However, it is not guaranteed that the maximum value of each asset will be deposited in the Pool. From the [Balancer V2 doc](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/36d282374b457dddea828be7884ee0d185db06ba/pkg/interfaces/contracts/vault/IVault.sol#L350-L352):
> The amounts to send are decided by the Pool and not the Vault: it just enforces these maximums.

This means that there might be leftover assets in the `BalancerRouter` that are not deposited into the pool, but are also not returned to the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

1. Not all assets are deposited into the Balancer Pool.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `joinBalancerAndPredeposit()` or `joinBalancerAndPlaza()`.
2. Maximum amount of tokens are sent to the `BalancerRouter`.
3. Not all of the tokens are deposited into the Pool, because he decides how much to deposit.

### Impact

The user will suffer loss of funds, because part of his assets will remain locked in the `BalancerRouter`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Send the remaining assets back to the user.
