# ​userBondShare​ and ​userLeverageShare​ may be rounded down to 0 during ​PreDeposit.claim

### Summary
​userBondShare​ and ​userLeverageShare​ may be rounded down to 0 during ​PreDeposit.claim​, leading to permanent loss of funds

In the `PreDeposit.claim` function, `userBondShare` and `userLeverageShare` are calculated based on the user's balance and the predefined `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount`. However, if the calculations for either `(bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount` or `(leverageAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount` result in a value that is rounded down to 0, the user will not receive any tokens. This issue is not checked, and the function executes normally, resulting in users losing their funds. Additionally, once the deposit period ends, users can no longer modify `bondAmount` or `leverageAmount`, making the loss permanent.

```solidity
function claim() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (pool == address(0)) revert ClaimPeriodNotStarted();
  
    uint256 userBalance = balances[msg.sender];
    if (userBalance == 0) revert NothingToClaim();

    address bondToken = address(Pool(pool).bondToken());
    address leverageToken = address(Pool(pool).lToken());

    uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
    uint256 userLeverageShare = (leverageAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;

    balances[msg.sender] = 0; 

    if (userBondShare > 0) {
      IERC20(bondToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, userBondShare);
    }
    if (userLeverageShare > 0) {
      IERC20(leverageToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, userLeverageShare);
    }

    emit Claimed(msg.sender, userBondShare, userLeverageShare);
}
```

If `bondAmount * userBalance < reserveAmount` or `leverageAmount * userBalance < reserveAmount`, both `userBondShare` and `userLeverageShare` may be rounded down to 0. Since there are no checks for this scenario, the user will lose their funds permanently.


### Root Cause

The absence of a check for `userBondShare` and `userLeverageShare` being zero leads to a situation where funds cannot be distributed properly.


### Attack Path

1. A user deposits `reserveToken` using the `PreDeposit.deposit` method.
2. After deposits end, the owner calls `PreDeposit.setBondAndLeverageAmount` to set `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount`.
3. The user calls `PreDeposit.claim` to retrieve their tokens. However, if the calculated `userBondShare` or `userLeverageShare` is 0 due to rounding, the user receives nothing.
4. The user cannot modify `bondAmount` or `leverageAmount` after the deposit period ends, leaving their funds permanently locked in the contract.

### Impact

Users permanently lose their funds due to rounding issues and lack of post-deposit modifications.


### Mitigation

1. During the `PreDeposit.setBondAndLeverageAmount` function, include checks to ensure that `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount` will not result in `userBondShare` or `userLeverageShare` being rounded down to 0 for any user.
2. Optionally, add a post-deposit adjustment mechanism to allow updates to `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount` before the claim period starts.
