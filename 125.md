# Chainlinkâ€™s latestRoundData might return stale or incorrect results

**Proof of Concept**

[src/OracleReader.sol L68](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L68)

The ChainlinkAdapter calls out to a Chainlink oracle receiving the latestRoundData(). If there is a problem with Chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. Chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale or incorrect data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
1. However, you should also verify that updatedTimestamp is non-zero, as a zero timestamp could indicate an invalid feed or an error in the oracle.
2. If the answer value is 0, the following line will cause a division by zero:
```solidity 
return isInverted ? (10 ** decimals * 10 ** decimals) / uint256(answer) : uint256(answer);
```
```solidity
(,int256 answer,,uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
(+) require(answer > 0, "Invalid price: answer is non-positive");
(+)require(updatedTimestamp != 0, "Invalid feed: timestamp is zero");
```
