# The calculation of fees in `Pool.sol` is incorrect.

### Summary

The calculation of fees in `Pool.sol` is incorrect. According to [`getFeeAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L719), the fee is positively correlated with both the balance of the reserve token and the time elapsed since last fee changed. Therefore, when the balance of the reserve token changes, the fee should be updated. But in fact, it is not. This leads to the fact that the fee amounts calculated in [`simulateCreate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273) and [`simulateRedeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433) are greater than they should be, resulting in an incorrect calculation of poolReserves.




### Root Cause

In `create` and `redeem`, the balance of reserve token changes, but the fee amount is not updated. This leads to subsequent incorrect calculations of `poolReserves ` in [`simulateCreate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273) and [`simulateRedeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433).

### Mitigation

When the balance of reserve token changes, update the fee amount and fee update time. And the calculation of the fee amount should be as follows:
```solidity
function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
-   return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
+   return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeUpdateTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
}
```
