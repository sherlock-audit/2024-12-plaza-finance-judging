# TickMath might revert in solidity version 0.8

### Summary

UniswapV3's TickMath library was changed to allow compilations for solidity version 0.8. However, adjustments to account for the implicit overflow behavior that the contract relies upon were not performed. The BondOracleAdapter.sol is compiled with version 0.8 and directly uses this library. In the worst case, it could be that the library always reverts (instead of overflowing as in previous versions), leading to a broken BondOracleAdapter contract.
The same pragma solidity >=0.5.0; instead of pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.8.0;

versions <0.8 and one for 0.8 from the 0.8 branch.d to calculate the TWAP
