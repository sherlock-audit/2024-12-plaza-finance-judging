# `BalancerRouter.joinBalancerPool()` should use `forceApprove` instead of `safeIncreaseAllowance`.

### Summary

The `BalancerRouter.joinBalancerPool()` function currently uses `safeIncreaseAllowance`. This approach causes issues with `USDC`, as `USDC` does not permit changing the approved amount from a non-zero value to another non-zero value.

The `joinBalancerPool()` function is intended to convert the caller's assets into a target token. However, due to fluctuations in the `Balancer` protocol, the approved assets may not be fully utilized, resulting in remaining approved amounts. Consequently, any subsequent calls will revert for `USDC`, as the function attempts to increase the approved amount from non-zero to non-zero.

### Root Cause

The [joinBalancerPool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L74) function utilizes `safeIncreaseAllowance`.

At lines 73 and 74, it first transfers the required assets from the caller and then approves them for the `balancerVault`. However, due to the fluctuations in the `Balancer` protocol, the assets may not be fully used, leaving some approved amounts remaining. Therefore, the next call to this function will revert because `safeIncreaseAllowance` does not work for `USDC`.

```solidity
  function joinBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        // Transfer assets from user to this contract
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
73          IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
74          IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]);
        }

        IVault.JoinPoolRequest memory request = IVault.JoinPoolRequest({
            assets: assets,
79          maxAmountsIn: maxAmountsIn,
            userData: userData,
            fromInternalBalance: false
        });

        // Join Balancer pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));
86      balancerVault.joinPool(poolId, address(this), address(this), request);
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        return balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter - balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

This issue can break core functionality of the protocol.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Use `forceApprove` instead of `safeIncreaseAllowance` to avoid issues with `USDC` and ensure smooth operation of the `joinBalancerPool()` function.
