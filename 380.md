# There are shares in a period with failed auctions, which leads to some users receiving rewards from other users from successful periods

### Summary

There is no protection against shares being distributed if an auction fails. The problem with this is that no rewards are added to the distributor for these shares. So, if claims are made with these shares, one receives coupons that actually belong to other users from a successful period.

### Root Cause

Each time a new auction is started, a new period begins with the function `startAuction`. Users receive their shares when they transfer or redeem their bondETH. The bondETH contract then keeps track of how many shares a user owns.

In this function, you can see that for each period, shares are distributed to the user's balance. You can also see that there is no check to determine whether the period was successful or not. As a result, users receive shares even when there are no rewards for the period.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There must be an auction that fails

### External Pre-conditions

No interaction with external contracts

### Attack Path

1. Alice owns 100 shares from a period that was successful, meaning there are 100 coupon tokens in the distributor, but she hasn't claimed them yet
2. Bob mints 10 bondETH  
3. The `startAuction` function is called for this period, but the auction fails because not enough coupon tokens were sold.  
4. Bob receives 25 shares for his bondETH although the auction failed
5. Bob calls `claim` and receives 25 coupon tokens from the distributor.  
6. Alice now wants to claim her rewards but gets nothing because only 75 coupon tokens remain in the distributor, which are insufficient to cover Alice's rewards.  

### Impact

Users with shares from failed periods get too many tokens and users with shares from successful periods may no longer be able to claim because too many coupon tokens have already been claimed for the shares from failed periods.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When the shares for a user are calculated in `Bond.sol` then there should be a check that only shares are distributed for periods with a successful auction.
