# When redeeming levETH while collateral level is greater than the threshold the redeem rate is compared with bondETH's market rate.

## Bug description
When redeeming levETH while collateral level is greater than the threshold, the redeem rate is calculated in the following way:

[Pool.sol#L513-L514](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L513-L514)
```solidity
redeemRate =
    ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) *
    PRECISION;
```

However, later in the function redeem rate is compared with the market price of bondETH and set to the lowest of two values.

[Pool.sol#L519-L521](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L519-L521)
```solidity
if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
    redeemRate = marketRate;
}
```

This is incorrect, as this check should only be applied to the redeemRate of bondETH or redeemRate of levETH when collateral level is lesser than the threshold but not to redeemRate of  levETH when collateral level is greater than the threshold. This will lead to incorrect redeem rate used to calculate the amount of reserve tokens user should receive for their levETH, which will always be lesser than the actual redeem rate.

## Root cause
Comparing levETH's redeem rate with bondETH's market rate when collateral level is greater than the threshold.

## Attack path
No attack path

## Impact
Incorrect calculations of levETH redeem rate leading to user's losses when redeeming levETH.
## Recommended Mitigation
When collateral level is greater than the threshold redeemRate of levETH should not be compared with market rate.
