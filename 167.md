# Allowance Not Reset to Zero After Withdrawal in exitBalancerPool

### Summary

The `exitBalancerPool` function in `BalancerRouter.sol` facilitates the withdrawal of tokens from a Balancer pool by increasing the allowance for the Balancer Vault to execute the exit operation. However, the function does not reset the token allowance to zero after the withdrawal. This can leave residual allowances, potentially exposing users to risks of unauthorized token usage or exploits.

### Root Cause

```javascipt
 function exitBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenIn,
        uint256[] memory minAmountsOut,
        bytes memory userData,
        address to
    ) internal {
        IVault.ExitPoolRequest memory request = IVault.ExitPoolRequest({
            assets: assets,
            minAmountsOut: minAmountsOut,
            userData: userData,
            toInternalBalance: false
        });

        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), balancerPoolTokenIn);
        balancerVault.exitPool(poolId, address(this), payable(to), request);
    }
```
After exiting Balancer pool it is advised to set allowance to 0
