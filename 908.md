# Fixed USDC for Bond Token is not enforced

### Summary

The Bond Token owes 2.5 USD for every quarter amounting to 10 USD for every year. However This amount is not enforced in the protocol.

The protocol lets Users claim by how many shares they are owed instead. This will distribute more amount than necessary or lesser than supposed to for the Users.

The `sharesPerToken` state variable must be accounted for while claiming as the (shares balance / shares Per Token) is one Bond Token.
Then one Bond Token owes 2.5 USDC per quarter which can be the round id interval in Bond Token.

We see that coupon token is sent in the ratio of 1:1 of shares : USDC
Whereas It should account for number of shares in the Bond Token for a particular round and distribute USDC according to the Bond token balance instead of shares.

### Root Cause

The coupons are distributed based on amount of Bond shares instead of bond token.
