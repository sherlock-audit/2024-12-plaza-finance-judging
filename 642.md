# A user can Blacklist themselves in Auction process when coupon token is USDC

### Summary

In `Auction.sol` when number of bids exceed **1000** or when total coupon amount exceed **totalBuyCouponAmount** the protocol calls `_removeBid()` and `removeExcessBids()`. Both remove methods send the coupon token back to the original bidder. When the coupon token is USDC which is mentioned in the token integration list the user can blacklist himself after placing a bid.

```solidity
IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
```

### Root Cause

The problem lies in the below 2 methods. These methods will revert for blacklisted users.

### Attack Path

1. Alice bids in `Auction.sol` and blacklist itself.
2. Bob, Clara, Dom ........ bids until bid reaches 1000.
3. Now when Tom tries to put an higher auction the action will revert if Alice has the lowest bid. Because when system tries to `_removeBid()` for Alice it reverts as USDC transfer to Alice account reverts.

### Impact

- When the total bids > 1000 if the lowest bid is of attacker then it can't be removed. Meaning the auction can't proceed further.
- When the **totalBuyCouponAmount** has reached and lowest bid is of attacker again the auction is halt as we can't remove or decrease attacker's bid.

### Mitigation

Keep a mapping if refunds. Which user can claim themselves. So, it doesn't interrupt the Auction user flow.
