# Integer Division Precision Loss in PreDeposit.claim() Causes Small Depositors to Receive Zero Tokens During Launch Phase

## Summary
The PreDeposit.claim() function performs integer division without proper scaling, causing small depositors to potentially receive 0 tokens due to precision loss. This affects the fair distribution of bondETH and leverageETH tokens during the critical launch phase since the predeposit period is specifically designed to seed the initial pool with liquidity.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L172

```solidity
uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
uint256 userLeverageShare = (leverageAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
```

The issue here is that the proportional relationship can be broken when:
1. Small deposits are made, leading to very small userBalance/reserveAmount ratios
2. There are integer division rounding issues

For example:
```solidity
// Consider this scenario with 18 decimal tokens
reserveAmount = 1000 * 1e18 (total deposits)
userBalance = 0.1 * 1e18 (small deposit)
bondAmount = 100 * 1e18
userBondShare = (100e18 * 0.1e18) / 1000e18 = 0
```

Due to integer division rounding down to 0, this user would receive 0 bondETH tokens even though they should receive a small but non-zero amount.

The Pool contract handles similar ratio calculations but uses decimal normalization to preserve precision:
```solidity
// From Pool.sol
uint256 normalizedUserBalance = userBalance.normalizeTokenAmount(params.reserveToken, COMMON_DECIMALS);
uint256 normalizedReserveAmount = reserveAmount.normalizeTokenAmount(params.reserveToken, COMMON_DECIMALS);
```

## Impact
Since this occurs during the initial distribution and tokens are only minted once, these rounding losses are permanent and cannot be recovered. This violates the protocol's core mechanism of proportional distribution during launch seeding, where every deposit, regardless of size, should receive its corresponding share of bondETH and leverageETH tokens based on the total deposits made during the predeposit period. For a pool with 1000 total deposits, any user depositing less than 1% of the pool size would receive 0 tokens due to precision loss. 

Given typical LST/LRT prices:

- At $2000 ETH price, assuming pool size of 1000 ETH:
  - Total pool value: $2,000,000
  - Minimum deposit to avoid rounding to 0: 10 ETH ($20,000)
  - Users depositing <$20,000 would receive 0 tokens

This effectively:
1. Creates an invisible barrier of $20,000 minimum deposit
2. Permanently excludes retail participants (<$20k) from launch phase
3. Cannot be fixed after launch as tokens are only minted once

## Recommended mitigation steps
1. Add proper scaling to preserve precision in ratio calculations:

```solidity
function claim() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (pool == address(0)) revert ClaimPeriodNotStarted();
    
    uint256 userBalance = balances[msg.sender];
    if (userBalance == 0) revert NothingToClaim();

    address bondToken = address(Pool(pool).bondToken());
    address leverageToken = address(Pool(pool).lToken());
    
    // Scale up by PRECISION (e.g. 1e18) before division to preserve precision
    uint256 PRECISION = 1e18;
    
    uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance * PRECISION) / reserveAmount;
    userBondShare = userBondShare / PRECISION;
    
    uint256 userLeverageShare = (leverageAmount * userBalance * PRECISION) / reserveAmount;
    userLeverageShare = userLeverageShare / PRECISION;

    balances[msg.sender] = 0;

    if (userBondShare > 0) {
        IERC20(bondToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, userBondShare);
    }
    if (userLeverageShare > 0) {
        IERC20(leverageToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, userLeverageShare);
    }

    emit Claimed(msg.sender, userBondShare, userLeverageShare);
}
```

2. Add minimum deposit validation in deposit function to prevent dust amounts

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
    require(amount >= MIN_DEPOSIT, "Deposit amount too small");
    // ... rest of deposit logic
}
```
This ensures that even small depositors receive their fair proportion of tokens, maintaining the integrity of the launch phase distribution.
