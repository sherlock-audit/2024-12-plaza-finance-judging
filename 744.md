# Incorrect Calculation of Token Creation and Redemption Rates Due to BondOracleAdapter

### Summary

The `BondOracleAdapter` uses the TWAP implementation, and the use of `getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD)` in conjunction with the calculation formula `FullMath.mulDiv(sqrtPriceX96, sqrtPriceX96, FixedPoint96.Q96)` produces extremely large values for **ethPrice**. This results in incorrect calculations during the creation and redemption of tokens, affecting the pool's users, as they may receive or redeem incorrect amounts of tokens.


### Root Cause


If we use the `BondOracleAdapter` contract for calculating the price, the `latestRoundData` function will return the value of the bond token (`bondToken`) with the liquidity token (`liquidityToken`) based on the TWAB amount of the specific pool. In the `BondOracleAdapter:latestRoundData` function, the oracle price calculation in `[getPriceX96FromSqrtPriceX96](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L117)`:

```solidity
return FullMath.mulDiv(sqrtPriceX96, sqrtPriceX96, FixedPoint96.Q96);
```

produces an unreasonably large number because `sqrtPriceX96 * sqrtPriceX96` results in an inflated value. This issue is exacerbated by the `fixed-point` precision of `FixedPoint96.Q96`. The excessively high value skews the oracle price returned by `getOraclePrice`.  

Additionally, we have set the fixed decimals for the price feed to 18 (`decimals = IERC20(_bondToken).safeDecimals();`). When this calculation is performed in the pool during token creation or redemption:

```solidity
uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
```

the value of `ethPrice` becomes extremely large, and converting it to `oracleDecimals` (which is set to 18) results in a very small final value. This leads to incorrect token creation and redemption rates in the `Pool` contract.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


1. A user attempts to create or redeem tokens in the `Pool` contract.
2. The `BondOracleAdapter.getOraclePrice` function is called to fetch the price.
3. The inflated oracle price skews the calculations in `simulateCreate` or `simulateRedeem`.
4. The user receives fewer tokens (in the case of creation) or fewer reserves (in the case of redemption) than expected, incorrect amounts of tokens.


### Impact

The use of the `BondOracleAdapter` results in excessively large values returned by the TWAP implementation, leading to incorrect TVL calculations. This causes inaccurate token creation and redemption rates in the `Pool` contract, which can lead to significant financial discrepancies for users and disrupt the system's integrity.


### PoC


```solidity
function testLatestRoundData() public {
    // Mock the observe call on the pool
    int56;
    tickCumulatives[0] = 100000; // Tick at t-30min
    tickCumulatives[1] = 200000; // Tick at t-0
    uint160;
    
    vm.mockCall(
        dexPool,
        abi.encodeWithSelector(ICLPoolDerivedState.observe.selector),
        abi.encode(tickCumulatives, secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s)
    );

    // Get the latest round data
    (, int256 answer, , ,) = adapter.latestRoundData();

    // Verify the returned value
    assertEq(answer, 79665096027561846390902814542);
    console.log(answer);
}
```

The `poolReserves` for the `bondToken/liquidityToken` pair is `100e18`.  
The `ethPrice` returned from TWAP is `79665096027561846390902814542`.  
The `oracleDecimals` is set as `decimals = IERC20(_bondToken).safeDecimals();` which equals `18`.

If this value is used in the following calculation:

```solidity
uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
```

The calculation becomes:

> **tvl = (79665096027561846390902814542 * 100e18) / (1e18)**  
> **tvl = 7966509602756184639090281454200**

This results in an extremely large `tvl` value: `7966509602756184639090281454200`.

Consequently, the calculation of the `collateralLevel` becomes excessively large:

```solidity
collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / 
                  ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
```

```solidity
uint256 private constant COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD = 1200000;
```

The `collateralLevel` value will always exceed the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`. Thus, the condition:  

```solidity
if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
```


### Mitigation


Avoid using the `BondOracleAdapter` for price calculations, as it returns excessively large values from the TWAP implementation, leading to incorrect TVL calculations. Instead, use a more reliable oracle mechanism that provides accurately scaled price data to ensure correct TVL and collateral level computations.
