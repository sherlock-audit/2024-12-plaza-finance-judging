# Failed auctions will leave `bondToken` holders uncompensated.

### Summary
In the current implementation of the auction protocol, if an auction fails, some bond token holders who were expecting coupon token compensation for their bonds will not receive it. 
The protocol does not have a mechanism to resolve failed auctions, such as conducting a new auction or including the failed auction's deficit in the next auction. 
This means that some bond token holders will not receive rewards..

### Root Cause
The auction process assumes that either the auction succeeds or [`fails`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L339-L343).
There is no mechanism to automatically trigger a new auction or provide an alternative compensation method.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Auction failed for various reasons.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Impact

Some `bondToken` holders can't receive the reward.

### Mitigation

Conduct a new auction or `couponToken` amount from the failed auction should be included in the next auction.
