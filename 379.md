# [M-02] Missing Maximum Threshold for _poolSaleLimit Risks Depleting Pool Reserves in Pool.sol.

### Summary

The absence of a maximum threshold for `poolSaleLimit` in `Pool.sol` allows excessively high values to be set leading to miscalculations and risking the depletion of pool reserves. This could destabilize the protocol by leaving insufficient liquidity for redemption operations, fees or emergency needs, directly impacting the usability and trust in the protocol.

### Root Cause

`poolSaleLimit` reset by `Pool:setPoolSaleLimit` @
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L176C3-L183C4
and
`poolSaleLimit` set in initializer to `90`: @
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L165

As per the protocol's documentation "A new auction is created, and the system sets a 10-day period for participants to bid for ETH related assets using USDC. A portion of the underlying assets (like wstETH) in the pool are made available for bidding, **not to exceed 95% percent of the value of the pool.**"
The setPoolSaleLimit function enforces a minimum limit but does not define a maximum limit for `poolSaleLimit`. Without a maximum cap, the function permits setting values close to or equal to 100%, allowing nearly all the pool's reserves to be made available for auctions.

Excessive allocation of reserves to auctions could exhaust liquidity, disrupting the protocol’s core functionalities like derivative redemption, claiming fees and coupon distribution.
Related mechanisms relying on pool reserves, such as emergency liquidity provisions, could also fail.

In addition - although the functionality is controlled by trusted entity, inconsistencies in the code comments in 
- `Pool.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L39
- and `Auction.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L91 , 
 could lead to admin unknowingly resetting the `poolSaleLimit` to higher uint value (i.e. 95 000 instead of 95).


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An excessively high value for `poolSaleLimit` (e.g., 95% or higher) is set via `Pool:setPoolSaleLimit`.
2. Auctions are conducted at high reserve allocation, quickly draining the pool by calling `Pool:endAuction` and bypassing the check in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341.


### External Pre-conditions

1. A redemption request or other protocol function dependent on reserves is executed after auction depletion.

### Attack Path

Assume the following:
- Initial poolReserves = 1,000 units (e.g., wstETH)
- `poolSaleLimit` = 99%
- Auction demand matches the full allocation of 990 units.
1. The protocol sets `poolSaleLimit` to 99%.
2. A large auction is conducted, depleting 990 units of the pool.
Remaining poolReserves = 10 units.
3. A user attempts to redeem derivatives (e.g., bondETH) for underlying assets. The call reverts because reserves are insufficient to satisfy redemption obligations or meet slippage thresholds.

### Impact

Liquidity Risk - Depletion of pool reserves undermines the ability to fulfill redemption requests for derivatives like `bondETH` or `levETH`.
Emergency liquidity needs are unserviceable, exposing the protocol to insolvency risks.

Auction Inefficiency- High reserve allocation may flood auctions with assets, reducing their perceived scarcity and suppressing bidding competition. This could result in lower USDC raised for distribution.

User Confidence Erosion - Users unable to redeem derivatives due to depleted reserves may lose trust in the protocol’s reliability.

Economic Instability - A drained pool exposes the protocol to cascading failures, as multiple mechanisms relying on reserves (auctions, redemptions, emergency funds) compete for limited resources.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a maximum cap on `poolSaleLimit` (e.g. as implemented in the `Pool:setFee`) to ensure sufficient reserves are retained for other protocol functions. 
`require(_poolSaleLimit <= MAX_POOL_SALE_LIMIT, "PoolSaleLimit exceeds maximum threshold");`
OR

Implement mechanisms to dynamically adjust `poolSaleLimit` based on the pool’s utilization and reserve balance to prevent over-allocation.
