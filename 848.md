# Lacking slippage control in the coupon auction, bidders may buy a large amount of reserve tokens with a small amount of coupon tokens.

### Summary

Due to the lack of slippage control, a bidder can bid `slotsize` coupon tokens to purchase a large amount (`<MAX_BID_AMOUNT = 1e50`) of reserve tokens, thereby causing great losses of reserve tokens to the protocol.



### Root Cause

There is no slippage control in the [`bid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125) function, meaning that bidders can bid with small amount of coupon tokens for any amount of reserve tokens, as long as the bid is not removed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Alice makes `maxBids` bids, each time offering a very low price for the reserve tokens.
2. When the auction concludes, Alice still has some bids that remain valid and are not removed.
3. The auction ends successfully.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. We assume that the market price of coupon token is N in reserve tokens.
2. Alice bids `maxBids` times, each time using [`slotsize`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L127) coupon tokens to purchase `10` * `slotsize * N` reserve tokens. This ensures that enough coupon tokens can definitely be obtained in the auction.
3. Others continue to bids. If a higher price for reserve tokens is offered in a bid, one of Alice's bids will be removed.
4. When the auction ends, if Alice still has some valid bids, and the [`totalSellReserveAmount` does not exceed the `poolSaleLimit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341), she will receive a tenfold return of reserve tokens. 
5. Notice that Alice can bid for any amount of reserve tokens (i.e `1000` * `slotsize * N`), as long as the `totalSellReserveAmount` does not exceed the `poolSaleLimit` when the auction ends.





### Impact

Users can bid for any quantity of reserve tokens with a small number of coupon tokens. If this bid is not squeezed out when the auction concludes, it will lead to substantial losses of reserve tokens for the protocol.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add slippage control in the `bid` function to prevent the price of reserve tokens offered by the bidder from deviating too much from the actual value.
