# [M] Premature Distribution Possible Due To Insufficient State Validation

### Summary

### Medium severity
The `distribute()` function in the Pool contract can be called immediately after startAuction(), allowing potential premature distribution attempts before the auction period is completed.

While currently reverts due to insufficient balance, this represents a significant violation of core system assumptions and state management, as the function:
1. It allows distribution attempts before auction completion
2. Violates the intended sequential flow of auction → processing → distribution
3. Could lead to fund distribution issues if balance checks are modified

### Root Cause

In [Pool.sol#L589](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589), the distribute() function only checks if currentPeriod > 0 but doesn't verify the auction state. Since startAuction() increments the period, distribute() becomes callable immediately after auction starts, breaking the intended flow where distribution should only happen after a successful auction completion.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Governance needs to call startAuction() to set currentPeriod to be greater than 0
2. User needs to call create() with TokenType.BOND to set bondToken balance to be greater than 0

### External Pre-conditions

**None required** - the vulnerability stems purely from internal contract state management issues and doesn't rely on any external protocol conditions or price movements.

### Attack Path


1. The protocol starts a new auction period by calling `startAuction()`, which increments currentPeriod
2. Due to missing state validation in `distribute()`, it becomes immediately callable since it only checks if `currentPeriod > 0`
3. An attacker can call `distribute()` right after `startAuction()`, before the auction is properly processed
4. While the transaction currently reverts due to insufficient balance, the premature access to `distribute()` violates the core protocol assumption that distribution should only happen after auction completion
5. This bypass of intended protocol flow could become more severe if the coupon token balance check is modified or if other system parameters change

### Impact

1. Protocol Flow Violation: The vulnerability breaks a fundamental protocol assumption that distribution should only occur after auction completion and processing
2. Potential Token Distribution Issues: If the protocol evolves or if token balance checks are modified, premature distribution could lead to incorrect token allocation to bondholders
3. System State Inconsistency: Early distribution attempts could create inconsistent states between auction and distribution processes
4. Security Risk: The lack of proper state validation in a critical function handling token distribution represents a serious security concern.
5. Protocol Design Violation: Contradicts the documented flow: "Once the auction is fully processed, the USDC collected from the winning bids is transferred to the pool"

### PoC

```solidity
    function testDistributeImmidiatelyAfterAuctionStarted() public {
        vm.startPrank(governance);
        Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);

        // Mint reserve tokens
        rToken.mint(governance, 10000001000);
        rToken.mint(user, 1000);
        rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 10000000000);

        // Create pool and start auction
        Pool _pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(params, 10000000000, 10000, 10000, "", "", "", "", false)); // 0 days for distribution period

        _pool.setAuctionPeriod(2 days);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);
        _pool.startAuction();
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user);
        rToken.approve(address(_pool), 1000);
        uint256 amount = _pool.create(Pool.TokenType.BOND, 1000, 0);

        // Can call distribute() immediately after startAuction
        _pool.distribute(); // Reverts with ERC20InsufficientBalance
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(currentPeriod > 0, "AccessDenied");

    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    
    // Add critical checks for auction state and existence
    require(auctions[previousPeriod] != address(0), "No auction for period");
    require(Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.SUCCEEDED,"Auction not succeeded");
    
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();
    
    // Ensure sufficient balance before proceeding
    require(
        IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) >= couponAmountToDistribute,
        "Insufficient coupon balance"
    );

    // Rest of the function remains the same...
}
```
