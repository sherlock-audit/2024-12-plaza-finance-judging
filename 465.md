# Attacker can get whole bond and leverage token of preDeposit with very less reserve token

### Summary

In `preDeposit` contract, there will be a reserve cap upto which users can deposit and after the deposit period ends user will get bond token and leverage token against their reserve token.

Here, user will get the bond and leverage token in the proportion of his percentage in the total reserve deposited during preDeposit period. That means if out of 100 total reserve 10% is of a user then that user will get 10% of the bond and leverage amount.

Because of this an attacker can manipulate and get all the bond and leverage token with very few reserve tokens which i have explained in the attack path.

### Attack Path

- At the start of the deposit period attacker will deposit the full amount upto the reserve cap.
- So no other user can deposit reserve token due to the cap limit.
- Now just before the deposit period end, attacker will withdraw almost of his reserves like 90-95% or even more.
- So now there will be very few reserve tokens in the contract but users will not able to deposit because deposit period ends.
- Now attacker will call `createPool` and pool will be created because there is some reserve tokens of the attacker.
- At the end attacker will claim his shares so all the bond and leverage tokens will be transferred to the attacker because he holds 100% of the reserves.
- This is how attacker will get all bond and reserves of the preDoposit with very few reserve tokens.
- After getting more bond tokens attacker can get share per token which is expected to be 2.5e(share decimals) so can get way more rewards.

### Impact

All the bond and leverage token can be claimed with very few reserve tokens so its a loss of funds and also it will impact the pool which is created. The created pool have very less reserves and more bond and leverage tokens so attacker will get more rewards and pool will be highly impacted.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Protocol should make sure that with such few reserve tokens, all the bond and leverage should not be transferred and may be the formula of the userBondShare and userLeverageShare needs to be changed.
