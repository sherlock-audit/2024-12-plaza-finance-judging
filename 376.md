# If one auction fails, some users can't withdraw their funds

### Summary

In the current implementation if one auction fails, the distribution of tokens will be not possible for this period. In this case all of the users who hold their bondTokens for this period will be not eligible for any rewards. Their shares will be their, but the couponTokens will be not distributed.

### Root Cause

If auction fails user's can't claim for this period, which means holding the bond token for this period will not result in any rewards. Users who have shares for this period will still be eligible for claiming rewards, but from next auctions, even if they didn't hold tokens for the next auction. There will be not enough funds for everyone who has bond tokens during even when one auction has failed.

### Impact

Some of the users who has shares will be not eligible for claiming all of their, due to insufficient number of coupon tokens in the contract due to failed auction.

### PoC

1. **Setup**:
   - A distribution period of 30 days.
   - An auction period of 15 days.

2. **Scenario**:
   - On day 31, users initiate an auction, and coupon tokens are collected over the subsequent 15 days.
   - By day 46, if there are insufficient funds in the Pool for the reserve amount, the auction will fail.

3. **Result**:
   - Users are unable to claim any rewards for this period, even though they hold bondTokens.
   - In subsequent successful auctions, users can claim tokens. However, their shares will disproportionately claim more coupon amounts than the actual coupons available in the contract, leading to imbalances and some user with shares will be not able to claim their coupons.
