# Potential Exploit in Pool Distribution Logic

### Summary

```solidity
function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());

    // Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount(); 
    if (Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT ||
        Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD) { 
      emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
      return;
    }

    // Get Distributor
    address distributor = poolFactory.distributors(address(this));

    // Transfer coupon tokens to the distributor
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(distributor, couponAmountToDistribute);   

    // Update distributor with the amount to distribute
    Distributor(distributor).allocate(couponAmountToDistribute); // @audit 为什么需要两个函数呢

    emit Distributed(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute, distributor);
}
```

The `Pool.distribute` method can be called at any time, and only checks for the states `Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` and `Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD`. Assuming the current period is `n`, the auction can still be in the `Auction.State.BIDDING` state before `Auction.endAuction` is called. The `endTime` is a public variable, which allows timestamp manipulation.

```solidity
uint256 public endTime;
```

When the timestamp reaches `endTime`, the period is still equal to `n`.

```solidity
function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() { 
    // Check if distribution period has passed
    require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod < block.timestamp, DistributionPeriodNotPassed());
    // Check if auction period hasn't passed
    require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());

    ...

    // Increase the bond token period
    bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);
    // Update last distribution time
    lastDistribution = block.timestamp;  // @audit 在创建拍卖时更新lastDistribution
}
```

Every time the `Pool.startAuction` is called, the bond token period is increased, and `lastDistribution` is updated. However, it is possible for attackers to compute the earliest time to call `Pool.startAuction` based on the storage slots.

```solidity
uint256 private sharesPerToken;
uint256 private distributionPeriod; // in seconds
uint256 private auctionPeriod; // in seconds
uint256 private lastDistribution; // timestamp in seconds
```

This means an attacker can determine when to call `Pool.startAuction`, thus controlling the start time of the next period, even before a normal user has called `Auction.endAuction`. This creates a potential exploit path.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker waits for the auction of period `n` to end. After the auction ends, the normal user does not timely call `Auction.endAuction` to update the state.
2. The attacker reads the relevant state variables from storage slots and calls `Pool.startAuction` at the earliest possible time. This sets the current period to `n+1`, while the auction corresponding to period `n` remains in the `Auction.State.BIDDING` state, prior to the normal user calling `Auction.endAuction`.
3. The attacker then immediately calls `Pool.distribute`. Since the function only checks for the states `Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` and `Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD`, it executes normally, regardless of the actual outcome of the auction for period `n`.

### Root Cause

Normal users may not timely call `Auction.endAuction` to update the state, allowing an attacker to exploit this timing issue.

### Affected Code

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L597-L598](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L597-L598)

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the distribution process, leading to unintended transfers of funds, potential loss of assets, and undermining the integrity of the auction system.

### Mitigation

Implement a check to ensure that the auction state is `Auction.State.SUCCEEDED` before proceeding with the distribution logic. This would prevent the distribution of funds if the auction has not been completed successfully.

```solidity
require(Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.SUCCEEDED, AuctionNotSucceeded());
```

By adding this requirement, the function will only execute under valid conditions, reducing the potential for exploitation.
