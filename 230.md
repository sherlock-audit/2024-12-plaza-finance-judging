# DoS of coupon claiming if one of the auction fails.

## Bug description
When the auction is started, `bondToken::increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken)` is called, which stores the period of the auction in the `previousPoolAmounts` array with `sharesPerToken` value passed to it.

[BondToken.sol#L218-L226](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L218-L226)
```solidity
globalPool.previousPoolAmounts.push(
    PoolAmount({
        period: globalPool.currentPeriod,
        amount: totalSupply(),
        sharesPerToken: globalPool.sharesPerToken
    })
);
globalPool.currentPeriod++;
globalPool.sharesPerToken = sharesPerToken;
```

The crux of the issue is the fact that `sharesPerToken` for a period is incremented regardless of the outcome of the auction for that period.

Consider a scenario with `sharesPerToken` equals to 10 and there is one user in the Pool. Current period is 0, `startAuction()` is called, which calls `bondToken::increaseIndexedAssetPeriod()`, which pushes period 0 to `previousPoolAmounts` array with `sharesPerToken` set to 10 and `currentPeriod` is incremented to 1. Auction succeeds, `endAuction()` is called, which transfers 10 USDC to the Pool.

[Auction.sol#L343-L347](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L343-L347)
```solidity
} else {
    state = State.SUCCEEDED;
    Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(
        beneficiary,
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this))
    );
}
```

Then `distribute()` is called on the pool, which transfers 10 USDC to the distributor contract and allocates shares for users to claim.

[Pool.sol#L608-L611](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L608-L611)
```solidity
// Transfer coupon tokens to the distributor
IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(distributor, couponAmountToDistribute);
// Update distributor with the amount to distribute
Distributor(distributor).allocate(couponAmountToDistribute);
```

[Distributor.sol#L117-L120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L117-L120)
```solidity
require(address(pool) == msg.sender, CallerIsNotPool());
address couponToken = pool.couponToken();
couponAmountToDistribute += _amountToDistribute;
```

Now user does not claim their shares for the period 0 before the next auction starts. `startAuction()` is called again, `bondToken::increaseIndexedAssetPeriod()` is called, which pushes period 1 to `previousPoolAmounts` with `sharesPerToken` equal to 10, and `currentPeriod` is incremented to 2. Auction fails for some reason, so no USDC is transferred to the distributor. User attempts to claim his shares for the period 0 and calls `claim()` on the distributor. To calculate the amount of shares user is entitled to, `bondToken::getIndexedUserAmount()` is called. This function will loop through period starting from the user's last updated period up to the current period. 

[BondToken.sol#L194-L196](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L194-L196)
```solidity
for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
    shares += (balance *
        globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(
            SHARES_DECIMALS
        );
}
```

shares will be calculated as the sum of shares for the period 0 and period 1, so the total amount will equal 20. And when distributor will attempt to transfer those shares to the user, the transaction will revert as distributor only has 10 USDC, since the second auction has failed.

[Distributor.sol#L88-L93](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L88-L93)
```solidity
uint256 shares = bondToken
    .getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
    .normalizeAmount(
        bondToken.decimals(),
        IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals()
    );
if (IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < shares) {
    revert NotEnoughSharesBalance();
}
```

## Root cause
Incrementing `sharesPerToken` for a period not considering the outcome of the auction for that period.

## Attack path
Described in the Bug Description section.


## Impact
DoS of coupon claiming.

## Recommended Mitigation
Increment `sharesPerToken` for a period only if the auction succeeded.
