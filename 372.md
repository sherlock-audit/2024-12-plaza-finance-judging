# Some coupon tokens will never be claimed and stuck in contract

### Summary

After each period of time, auctions will be hosted, which allows users to exchange coupon tokens for reserve tokens. When an auction is successfully concluded, coupon tokens will be sent back to pool, and then distributed in the `Distributor` contract. There will be some coupon tokens never claimed and stuck in the contract, some users may also never be able to claim coupon tokens, too.

### Root Cause

Here in the [`claim`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L78C1-L110C4) function of `Distributor` contract:
```solidity
  function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    BondToken bondToken = Pool(pool).bondToken();
    address couponToken = Pool(pool).couponToken();

    if (address(bondToken) == address(0) || couponToken == address(0)){
      revert UnsupportedPool();
    }

    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

    if (IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < shares) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesBalance();
    }
    
    // check if pool has enough *allocated* shares to distribute
    if (couponAmountToDistribute < shares) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesToDistribute();
    }

    // check if the distributor has enough shares tokens as the amount to distribute
    if (IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < couponAmountToDistribute) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesToDistribute();
    }

    couponAmountToDistribute -= shares;    
    bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
    
    emit ClaimedShares(msg.sender, currentPeriod, shares);
  }
```
 We see that users cannot claim more than what the contract holds, but this `shares` is retrieved from `bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount`, this value is accrued for bond token holders, and supposedly, the more bond token user holds, the more shares he would have. This introduces a few problems, though.

For a whale user, whose shares may just be too large, that he cannot claim coupon tokens because the contract may not have enough balance for all his shares. Also, there can be some "dust" amount never claimed, because the coupon amount may not be perfectly aligned with all user's shares, this will cause those "dust" amount to be stuck in contract forever.

Another reason for this to happen is because periods are increased when `startAuction` is called, but not auction can be successful, which makes more shares and less Coupon tokens in the system.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Alice is a whale user, and holds 2000 shares. 
2. The `Distributor` contract only holds 1500 coupon tokens
3. There are other users in the protocol, and their shares are: [100, 300, 600, 200]

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Based on internal pre-condition, since Alice has 2000 shares, and there are only 1500 tokens in the contract, so she cannot claim her part, and as her shares get bigger, the chance for her claim will be even less. Also if we look at all other users than Alice, the total claimable shares will be 100+300+600+200=1200, after their claims, there will still be 300 left unclaimed. Since there are no other users, those 300 cannot be claimed by Alice due to the same reason above, and be stuck in contract forever.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider re-design the dirtsbution logic, let user choose how much to claim, or for per share, some coupon tokens will be given to them, to ensure all users can claim, and all coupon tokens will be claimed.
