# Bond threshold discount applies even after the collateral level reaches the threshold in the same txn

### Summary

A user can get an 80% discount on all of the bond tokens they create, even if their creation request is for many times the required amount to reach the collateral threshold level.

### Root Cause

The code that decides the creation rate does not consider whether the amount being deposited will _pass_ the [`COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L319-L343), only that it starts below the threshold:
```solidity
@>  uint256 multiplier = POINT_EIGHT;
    ...
    uint256 creationRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;

    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }
@>    creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      ...
    }
    
    return ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The collateral level is below the threshold
2. There are other bond holders that are currently under water


### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. The user calls `create()` with many multiples of the value required to reach the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`
2. The user, in the same transaction, calls `redeem()` for the amount of tokens needed to reach the threshold (i.e. redeems the portion of their shares that will be paid out at 100%)


### Impact

The creating user will get an 80% discount even on the multiples above the threshold, effectively stealing share value from the existing bond holders, in a risk-free manner. The value lost by the attacker, held by their un-redeemed shares, will be more than covered by the 80% discount of the shares redeemed at 100%.

### Mitigation

During creation, split the creation into two steps, where the first step is when the collateral level is below the threshold, and the second is to process the remaining amounts above the threshold (i.e. don't give those shares the discount). Alternatively, do what the redeem step does, and calculate the collateral level as if the shares had already been deposited.
