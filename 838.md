# Pro-forma CL computation can be abused to game the system

### Summary

Computing the CL pro-forma when redeeming bond tokens allows malicious users to game the system in some scenarios.

### Root Cause

In `getRedeemAmount`, the `collateralLevel` when the token to redeem is Bond [is computed in a pro-forma manner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L498). This means that the protocol simulates what the vault’s Collateral Level will be **after** redemption, instead of considering the current Collateral Level:

```solidity
// File: Pool.sol
function getRedeemAmount(
        TokenType tokenType,
        uint256 depositAmount,
        uint256 bondSupply,
        uint256 levSupply,
        uint256 poolReserves,
        uint256 ethPrice,
        uint8 oracleDecimals,
        uint256 marketRate
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
       ...

        uint256 collateralLevel;
        if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND) {
				
            collateralLevel = 
                ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) /  
                ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE); 
        } else {
        
        ...
        
    }
```

A malicious user can leverage this to:

1. Mint bond ETH.
2. Start an auction and be entitled to a certain amount of USDC.
3. Redeem the bond ETH without suffering a loss.

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario, where the system already allows for an auction to be started as the `distributionPeriod` for the current period has passed:

- `bondSupply` is 30e18
- The current TVL is $6000 (fees already excluded), with a ETH price of $6000 (setting an extreme scenario to showcase it still works if the price of ETH increases, which also increases the total deposit, and consequently the total minted bond tokens).
1. With the initial state, the current Collateral Level for bond creation is CL = 6000 / (30 * `BOND_TARGET_PRICE`) = 2. Because of this, the `creationRate` for bond is set to `BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION` ($100). User 1 deposits 10 WETH (which is $60000 at the current ETH price). With the computed creation rate, user 1 will obtain 600 bondETH (amount = 60000/100). This increases bondETH’s supply from 30e18 to 630e18.
2. User 1 then triggers `startAuction`. The bond token’s `increaseIndexedAssetPeriod` function is called, which increases the current period. Now, user 1 is entitled to 600 * 2,5 USDC = 1500 USDC corresponding to this period, which will be claimable after the auction ends (**independently if he holds the bondETH or not, given the shares distribution logic for bond tokens**).
3. After starting the auction, user 1 redeems the corresponding bond tokens. He redeems his full balance, 600 bond ETH. The maximum fee allowed by the protocol is 10%, which increases gradually over time. In the first distribution (distributions are triggered quarterly), the fee will be **at most 2.5%** (note the fee could be less, given that 10% is the maximum value, but there’s no actual minimum for the fee). Considering the $60000 worth of ETH deposited by user 1, and applying a 2.5% fee ($1500), the total TVL in the protocol is $6000 + $60000 - $1500 = $64500, considering the initial $6000 that were already in the protocol’s TVL. 
4. The pro-forma collateral level is computed in the following way: 
    
    ```solidity
    collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) /  
                    ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE); 
    ```
    
    This gives a pro-forma `collateralLevel` of ($64500 - (600 * 100)) / ((630 - 600) * 100) = 1.5 . **This makes the pro-forma collateral level make the protocol believe it is in a healthy state.** Because of this, the `redeemRate` is set to $100.
    
5. Considering this, the final amount to redeem is dictated by the last computation in `getRedeemAmount`:
    
    ```solidity
    (depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) /
                    ethPrice) / PRECISION;
    ```
    
    So user 1 can effectively redeem 600 * 100 / $6000 = 10 WETH, so the user has **fully redeemed their initial 10 WETH, and has obtained 1500 USDC that will be claimable when the auction period ends, effectively gaming the system.**

### Impact

The pro-forma collateral computation allows the user to game the system, having two main harmful outcomes:

- Users can claim bonds by depositing and withdrawing in the same transaction, effectively extracting value from the system without providing any benefit to the Pool.
- The amount of bonds required for an auction to be successful increases, potentially making the auction unsuccesful.

Given that USDC is extracted from the system for free, this issue should be considered of High severity, as the user is entitled to tokens that shouldn’t correspond to them in the first place.

### Mitigation

Remove pro-forma Collateral Level computations when redeeming bond tokens, and compute the collateral level the same way as in bond tokens creation:

```diff
// File: Pool.sol

function getRedeemAmount(
        TokenType tokenType,
        uint256 depositAmount,
        uint256 bondSupply,
        uint256 levSupply,
        uint256 poolReserves,
        uint256 ethPrice,
        uint8 oracleDecimals,
        uint256 marketRate
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
        if (bondSupply == 0) {
            revert ZeroDebtSupply();
        }

        
        uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals); 

        uint256 assetSupply = bondSupply;
        uint256 multiplier = POINT_EIGHT;

+        if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
+            multiplier = POINT_TWO;
+            assetSupply = levSupply;
+        }

+          uint256 collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / 
+           (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE); 
            
-         uint256 collateralLevel;

-        if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND) {

         
-            collateralLevel = 
-                ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) /  
-                ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE); 
-        } else {
-            multiplier = POINT_TWO;
-            assetSupply = levSupply;
            
-            collateralLevel =
-                (tvl * PRECISION) /
-                (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);

-            if (assetSupply == 0) {
-                revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
-            }
-        }
				  ...
