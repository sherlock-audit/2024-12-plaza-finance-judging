# User-provided `minAmount` allows excessive slippage

#### 1. Brief
The `create` and `redeem` functions rely on user-provided `minAmount` values to prevent unfavorable trades. If users set `minAmount` too low (e.g., due to misconfigured frontends), they may suffer significant slippage losses.  

#### 2. Description 
**Mechanism**:  
- Users specify `minAmount` to define the minimum tokens (for `create`) or reserve assets (for `redeem`) they will accept.  
- The protocol uses this value to revert trades if market conditions worsen beyond the userâ€™s tolerance.  

**Flaw**:  
- If `minAmount` is set too low (e.g., zero or an unreasonably small value), users may receive drastically fewer assets than expected due to:  
  - Oracle price manipulation (e.g., flash loan attacks).  
  - Legitimate market volatility (e.g., during liquidity crises).  
- Frontends that fail to suggest appropriate slippage tolerances exacerbate this risk.   

#### 3. Impact  
Users incur losses due to unfavorable trade execution. Losses depend on user error/market conditions

#### 4. Proof of Concept (PoC) 
**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Assume the fair price for 100 reserve tokens is 1 bond token.  
2. An attacker temporarily manipulates the oracle to report a price 10x higher.  
3. User calls `create` with `depositAmount = 100 reserveTokens` and `minAmount = 0`.  
4. The protocol mints `100 / 10 = 10 bondTokens` (90% loss).  

#### 5. Mitigation Steps
- Frontends should compute `minAmount` dynamically using real-time volatility data (e.g., 1-5% slippage).  
- Enforce a minimum slippage threshold (e.g., 0.5%) unless explicitly overridden by advanced users.
