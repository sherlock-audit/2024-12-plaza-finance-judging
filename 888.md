# Lack of Slipage protection on joinBalancerAndPredeposit function

### Summary

The function `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` is intended to perform two key actions: joining a Balancer pool and pre-depositing the resulting pool token. While it performs its tasks, there are potential vulnerabilities and improvements, particularly regarding the absence of slippage protection and handling deadlines.

### Root Cause

### 1 Lack of Slippage Protection:

**Problem:** The function does not include any form of slippage protection when joining the Balancer pool https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L23-L40. Slippage occurs when the price or rate of tokens changes between the time a transaction is submitted and when it is mined. Without slippage protection, the transaction may result in receiving fewer tokens than expected, potentially exposing users to unintended losses.

### 2 Deadline Handling:

**Problem:** The function does not account for transaction deadlines  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L23-L40, which is particularly important for functions interacting with decentralized protocols. Without a deadline, the transaction could be pending indefinitely or could result in undesirable behavior due to market fluctuations or gas issues.

The lack of both of these checks on this function before calling `predeposit` can cause unintended consequences that cannot be neglected
