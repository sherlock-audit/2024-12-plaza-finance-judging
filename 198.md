# Bid with high price effectively can end up with lower price

### Summary

In the `removeExcessBids` function, when the total bid amount exceeds `totalBuyCouponAmount`, the contract reduces the `sellCouponAmount` and `buyReserveAmount` of the lowest-ranked bidder proportionally. This reduction introduces precision loss due to integer division, leading to a scenario where bids initially made at a high price effectively end up with a lower price..

### Root Cause

On the line [Auction.sol#L281](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L281), `removeExcessBids` function reduces `sellCouponAmount` and `buyReserveAmount` proportionally. However, the reduction uses integer arithmetic, causing rounding errors that alter the price ratio (`sellCouponAmount / buyReserveAmount`).

### PoC

- Assume `totalBuyCouponAmount = 10e18`, `slotSize = 1e18` and `currentCouponAmount = 10e18`(full charged).
- The lowest bidder(bidder 1): `buyReserveAmount = 1e8`, `sellCouponAmount = 1e18`
- bidder 2: bids with `buyReserveAmount = 9e8`, `sellCouponAmount = 9e18`
  - price is same as the bidder 1's but sellCouponAmount is larger.
  - **bidder 1** is removed and bidder 2 enters the list.
  - **bidder 2**'s values change:
    - `amountToRemove = 8e18`
    - `proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount = 888888888888888888`
    - new `sellCouponAmount = 1e18`
    - new `buyReserveAmount = 9e8 - [9e8 * proportion] / 1e18 = 1e8 + 1`
- Result: **Bidder 2** has the lower price than **Bidder 1**.

### Impact

1. Bid with high price effectively can end up with lower price.
2. The lowest bidder can repeat the same operation as above to increase the size of `buyReserveAmount` without changing `sellCouponAmount`. 
  Attacker can either profit by 1wei(0.001 usd)  which is more than the gas fee if the token is WBTC. In this case, even if the attacker's gain is not great due to gas fees, the protocol loses a lot of reserve tokens.


### Mitigation

check whether the `buyReserveAmount` size increases before and after the bid.

```solidity
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns(uint256) {
    ...
    uint256 totalSellReserveAmountBefore = totalSellReserveAmount;

    Bid memory newBid = Bid({
    ...
    removeExcessBids();

    uint256 totalSellReserveAmountAfter = totalSellReserveAmount;
    if(totalSellReserveAmountBefore < totalSellReserveAmountAfter) revert TotalSellReserveAmountIncreased();
    ...
}
```
