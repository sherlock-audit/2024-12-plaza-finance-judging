# Use safeTransfer() instead of transfer()

### Summary

The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.
But `claimBid()` function uses the `transfer()` method instead of `safeTransfer()` in `Auction.sol`.

### Impact

Bidders may not be received tokens even if function call is done successfully.

### Mitigation

Use the `safeTransfer()` method by OpenZeppelin instead of `transfer()`.
