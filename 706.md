# Improper Fee has been collected in pool Contract on reserve token

## Description

When a user creates or redeems reserve tokens, the protocol deducts fees from the calculated amount the user receives. These fees are based on the pool reserves at the time of the create or redeem operation. Consequently, the pool reserves vary with each create or redeem action.

The actual fees are collected only when the fee collector calls the claimFees function or when a new fee rate is set by the governance role via the setFee function, as claimFees is invoked during this process.

## Vulnerability Details

Fees are calculated for the entire period between the last fee claim and the current timestamp.
If there is a significant change in the pool reserves just before the fee collector claims fees, this change impacts the fees for the entire period.
For instance, if the last claim was at timestamp = x and the next claim is made at timestamp= x + 100, but a major redeem event occurs at timestamp= x + 90, reducing the pool reserves, the fees for the entire period (timestamp=x to timestamp=x+10) are calculated on the reduced reserves. This results in a significant loss for the fee collector.
Conversely, if the pool reserves increase significantly during this period, the fee collector receives disproportionately higher fees.

## impact

if reserve token, significantly decreases before claim, fee collector will get low fee, than he should get and if reserve token increase before claim , then there will high for the fee collector , which means , 
pool reserve decreases, will ultimately result into loss of user.

## Mitigation

Protocol should make sure that, fee token is charged on reserve token for particular time, instead of whole period, from last claim timestamp on particular reserve.
