# Incorrect fee calculation when protocol call `Pool::claimFees` resulting really small amount of fees

### Summary

every create/redeem the protocol supposed to get fees, but the fees are not saved anywhere instead it recalculated when protocol calls the `claimFess` where the logic is incorrect because the fee are calculated from contract balance (and this balance can be reduced if user redeeming)

### Root Cause

when user create or redeem derivative tokens, the protocol supposed to get fee because the fee amount are deducted from those function:

[`simulateCreate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L262-L293)
```solidity
    // Calculate and subtract fees from poolReserves
@>  poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);

.
.
.
    return getCreateAmount(
      tokenType,
      depositAmount,
      bondSupply,
      levSupply,
      poolReserves,
      getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD),
      getOracleDecimals(reserveToken, USD)
    ).normalizeAmount(COMMON_DECIMALS, assetDecimals);
  }
```

[`simulateRedeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L422-L451)
```solidity
    // Calculate and subtract fees from poolReserves
@>  poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);

.
.
.
    return getRedeemAmount(
      tokenType,
      depositAmount,
      bondSupply,
      levSupply,
      poolReserves,
      getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD),
      oracleDecimals,
      marketRate
    ).normalizeAmount(COMMON_DECIMALS, IERC20(reserveToken).safeDecimals());
  }
```

however those value are not stored anywhere, and this is further became problematic when the `Pool::claimFees` is called.

because the `claimFess` is doing the calculation again by calling `getFeeAmount` and this are calculated from current contract balance:

[`getFeeAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L718-L720)
```solidity
  function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }
```

if the fee is 2% per year, current total reserveToken is 90:

at time = 0
- alice create bond token by depositing 10 reserveToken
- total reserveToken now = 100

at time = 1 year
- alice wants to redeem the bond token, because 2% fee, alice got 8 reserveToken only, 2 reserveToken held as fees
- contract reserveToken balance now 92 token
- protocol calls `claimFees` but only got `92 * 2% * 1 = 1.84 reserveToken` instead of 2 reserveToken because `getFeeAmount` function above

fees discrepancy would further became bigger when the contract balance reduced when user redeeming

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

inaccurate fee calculation would lead protocol to loss their own protocol fees

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

save the fee when user create/redeem to a contract state, and when claiming fees make sure to sent the amount saved and not recalculating it again from contract balance.
