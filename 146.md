# Not checking wheather the BondBeacon and levBeacon updated with new implementation when calling `PoolFactory.sol::createPool()`

### Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PoolFactory.sol#L124

As the beacon address are immutable, and they store implementation addresses. If the government calls the `createPool` 2nd, 3rd or nth time, without updating the BondBeacon and levBeacon with new implementation addresses. Then the new pool created will project to implementation address of BONDeth and levETH of previous pool, because beacons hasn't been updated with new implementations.

### Root Cause
In `create()` function not checking weather the BeaconBond and BeaconLeverage, have new implemenatation stored in it or not.
### Impact
The beacon contracts `BondBeacon` and `levBeacon`, will not project to the new implementations, which is the requirement in case of new Pool creation.
### Mitigation
Check wheather the `BondBeacon` has been uodated with new implementations or not before creating the new Pool.
