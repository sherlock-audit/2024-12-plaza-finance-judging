# PreDeposit DOS

### Summary

The `PreDeposit` contract is designed to maintain balances for users interested in participating in a pool even before its creation, allowing deposits and withdrawals. However, an attacker can occupy a significant portion—or even the entirety—of the pool, depending on the `reserveCap`, preventing honest users from using the contract.

### Root Cause

* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L25

The attack is possible due to the existence of a `reserveCap` limit for deposits and the lack of a withdrawal penalty (even a minimal one to discourage malicious users).

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker deposits to occupy the entirety—or a significant portion—of the reserveCap.

2. Before the depositEndTime, the attacker withdraws their tokens without incurring any penalty.

### Impact

Honest users aiming to interact with the protocol may face a denial-of-service (DOS) and might seek incentives in other protocols.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply a small penalty during withdrawals to discourage malicious behavior.
