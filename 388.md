# Incorrect `indexedAmountShares` update logic may cause the protocol to lose funds

### Summary

The `_update` function in the `BondToken` contract allows users to manipulate the `indexedAmountShares` calculation. Users can mint `BondTokens` just before a distribution period starts and withdraw immediately afterward, unfairly receiving profits corresponding to an entire distribution period without holding the bonds for the full duration.

### Root Cause

1. **Immediate Eligibility for Shares**:

   - The `_update` function multiplies `sharesPerToken` by the token holdings at the distribution period's start, regardless of how long the tokens were held during the period.

2. **No Proportionality to Holding Time**:

   - The system does not account for the actual holding duration of `BondTokens` within a distribution period when increasing `indexedAmountShares`.

### Attack Path

1. **Preparation**:

   - A user observes the protocol's distribution schedule.
   - The user ensures they have sufficient reserve tokens to mint `BondTokens`.

2. **Execution**:

   - Just before the distribution period begins, the user creates a large number of `BondTokens`.
   - After the distribution period starts, the user redeems, triggering the `_update` function.
   - The `indexedAmountShares` are calculated as if the `BondTokens` were held for the entire distribution period.

3. **Outcome**:
   - The user receives unearned profits in the form of `CouponTokens`.
   - Legitimate bondholders are diluted, and the protocol incurs an unfair distribution of rewards.

### Impact

Exploiters gain an unfair advantage by minting tokens briefly before the distribution period starts, destabilizing the reward mechanism.

### Mitigation

1. **Proportional Reward Distribution**:

   - Adjust the `indexedAmountShares` calculation to be proportional to the bond holding time during the distribution period.

2. **Require Full Holding Period**:

   - Only increase `indexedAmountShares` for bonds held for the entire distribution period.
