# DoS due to insufficient allowance in BalanceRouter.sol

### Summary

According to the sponsor in PT, the BalancerRouter.sol contract:

> should be reusable for other Pools that also want to use a BPT. 

BPT's address differs from pool to pool.

However, the protocol incorrectly assumes that the address of BPT is the same across all pool.

BPT is set as an immutable variable when the Balance Router is deployed:
```solidity
contract BalancerRouter is ReentrancyGuard {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    IVault public immutable balancerVault;
@>  IERC20 public immutable balancerPoolToken;

    constructor(address _balancerVault, address _balancerPoolToken) {
        balancerVault = IVault(_balancerVault);
@>      balancerPoolToken = IERC20(_balancerPoolToken);
    }
```

When Plaza launches a new pool for LSTs/LRTs and a user calls BalancerRouter::joinBalancerAndPlaza() passing in the new pool's ID, the transaction will always revert due to insufficient allowance.
```solidity
function joinBalancerAndPlaza(
        bytes32 balancerPoolId, // @audit user passes in the 2nd balance pool Plaza creates
...
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {


        uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = joinBalancerPool(balancerPoolId, assets, maxAmountsIn, userData);

        // @audit increases allowance for the originally deployed balancer pool
        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(_plazaPool, balancerPoolTokenReceived);

        // @audit reverts here when attempting to send the BPT from the router to the plaza pool due to insufficient allowance
        uint256 plazaTokens = Pool(_plazaPool).create(plazaTokenType, balancerPoolTokenReceived, minPlazaTokens, deadline, msg.sender);

        return plazaTokens;
    }
```

### Root Cause

The protocol assumes BPT will always be the same address, but it changes depending on the pool the BPT represents:

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Protocol deploys BalancerRouter.sol with the BPT they're launching with
2. Protocol assumes all BPT tokens utilize the same address and create another balancer pool for LSTs
3. Users calls `joinBalancerAndPlaza()` passing in the new balancer pool ID, but the transaction reverts due to insufficient allowance.

### Impact

The BalanceRouter breaks for any new Balancer pools the protocol creates for LSTs/LRTs

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Create a state variable that tracks approved BPTs and then add this as an input parameter to the user facing functions.
