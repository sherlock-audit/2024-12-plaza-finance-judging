# Missing Input Validation in initialize Function Will Cause Contract to Become Unusable for Users as Deployer Can Initialize with Zero Addresses

### Summary

The lack of input validation in the initialize function of the LeverageToken contract will cause the contract to become unusable for users as the deployer can initialize the contract with zero addresses. This will result in critical roles (minter, governance, and poolFactory) being assigned to address(0), preventing any further interaction with the contract.

### Root Cause

In `LeverageToken.sol:41` In [LeverageToken.sol:L41] https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/LeverageToken.sol#L41, the initialize function does not validate whether the input addresses (minter, governance, and poolFactory) are zero addresses. This allows the contract to be initialized in an invalid state, rendering it unusable.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Deployer needs to call the initialize function with minter, governance, or poolFactory set to address(0).

The contract must be in an uninitialized state (i.e., the initialize function has not been called before).

### External Pre-conditions

The deployer must have access to the contract deployment process.

No external protocols or oracles are involved in this vulnerability.

### Attack Path

The deployer deploys the LeverageToken contract and its proxy.

The deployer calls the initialize function with one or more of the following addresses set to address(0):

minter = address(0)

governance = address(0)

poolFactory = address(0)

The contract is initialized in an invalid state:

If minter is address(0), no one can mint or burn tokens.

If governance is address(0), no one can upgrade the contract or manage roles.

If poolFactory is address(0), the onlySecurityCouncil modifier will fail, preventing pausing and unpausing.

The contract becomes unusable, and users cannot interact with it.

### Impact

The contract becomes unusable if initialized with zero addresses. Users cannot mint, burn, pause, unpause, or upgrade the contract.
