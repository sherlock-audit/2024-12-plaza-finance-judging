# Users cant get refunds if they are outbid and the auction is successful

### Summary

Overly restrictive modifier will cause a fund lockup for outbid participants as auction contract will incorrectly block refund claims in successful auctions

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L367

### Root Cause

The choice to restrict refunds with auctionFailed modifier is a mistake as it prevents legitimate refund claims from outbid users in successful auctions

### Internal Pre-conditions

- User needs to place a bid
- Another user needs to place a bid to set highestBid to be greater than user's bid
- Auction needs to end successfully

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions required - this is an internal auction contract logic issue.

### Attack Path

1. User1 calls bid() with 100 USDC
2. User2 calls bid() with 200 USDC, outbidding User1
3. Time passes and auction ends naturally
4. Auction succeeds (highest bid meets reserve price)
5. User1 calls claimRefund() but transaction reverts due to auctionFailed modifier

### Impact

The outbid users cannot claim their refund of 100% of their bid amount when auction succeeds. In this test case, User1 loses access to 100 USDC.

### PoC

  function testOutbidAndRefund() public {
    // Setup first bidder
    address bidder1 = address(0x11);
    vm.startPrank(bidder1);
    usdc.mint(bidder1, 1000 ether);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(100 ether, 1000000000);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Setup second bidder with higher bid
    address bidder2 = address(0x12);
    vm.startPrank(bidder2);
    usdc.mint(bidder2, 2000 ether);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 2000 ether);
    auction.bid(200 ether, 1000000000);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // End auction
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
    auction.endAuction();

    // First bidder claims refund
    vm.startPrank(bidder1);
    auction.claimRefund(1);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Verify refund
    assertEq(usdc.balanceOf(bidder), 1000 ether);
  }
