High

# A bidder will place an extremely high bid can push totalSellReserveAmount beyond the pool limit, causing all bids to become invalid and the entire auction to fail abnormally.

### Summary

Summary
Because (1) removeExcessBids() only removes lower-priced bids (allowing excessively large, high-priced bids to remain), (2) the pool sale limit (poolSaleLimit) is enforced only during endAuction() (failing to stop over-limit bids earlier), and (3) any user can end the auction at will (including the malicious high bidder), these conditions will cause an abnormal auction failure for legitimate bidders as a malicious high bidder can place a massive high-priced bid (e.g. sellCouponAmount = totalBuyCouponAmount and 10000 USD per reserveToken), crowd out other participants in removeExcessBids(), and immediately invoke endAuction() to push totalSellReserveAmount over the pool limit in a single transaction when auction can end(block.timestamp >= endTime).

### Root Cause

Root Cause
it’s a conceptual mistake:
1.Excess bids are removed only from the lower-priced side
In removeExcessBids(), the contract only removes or reduces bids that are relatively lower-priced, and does not impose restrictions or partial removal on extremely large, high-priced bids(e.g. sellCouponAmount = totalBuyCouponAmount and 10000 USD per reserveToken). As a result, even if a new buyReserveAmount is very large, as long as its price is higher than other bids, it remains high in the linked list and will not be removed by removeExcessBids().

2.The auction logic checks the total sale volume poolSaleLimit only during final settlement in endAuction()
The code only enforces totalSellReserveAmount >= (poolBalance * poolSaleLimit) / 100 within endAuction(). There is no synchronous validation or limitation that would prevent large bids from driving the total beyond the limit earlier in the process. Consequently, a malicious bidder can exploit this gap to let totalSellReserveAmount grow excessively, causing the auction to fail immediately when settlement occurs.

```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Ends the auction and transfers the reserve to the auction.
   */
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

3.Any user can end the auction at a convenient time, even if they are a malicious bidder—enabling them to manipulate a normal auction in a single transaction
The contract does not impose strict limitations on who can call endAuction(). As soon as the auction is expired (auctionExpired), anyone—potentially a malicious bidder—can invoke endAuction(). Therefore, an attacker can place an extremely large, high-priced bid, and then, in the same transaction or right after, end the auction. At that point, totalSellReserveAmount may have already been pushed beyond the limit by their bid, forcing the auction to fail. This process can be carried out within a single block or transaction, leaving other participants virtually no time to react—effectively “hijacking” the entire auction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Internal Pre-condiction:Pre-conditions will vary as the pool operates. For the proof of concept, I have provided a pre-condition that allows the attack to succeed.
1. Auction's totalBuyCouponAmount >= 100000000000000000000000 USDC (1e23)
2. Pool's reserveToken balance <= 10000000000000000000 ether (1e19)
3. Pool's bondToken supply >= 10000*10**18 (1e22)
4. block.timestamp >= endTime (user can end the auction at a convenient time)

### External Pre-conditions

1.when auction can be end,attack can use high gas price attack transaction to be the first user to end the auction

### Attack Path

Attack Path In one attack transaction with high gas price
1. attacker call bid() and set buyReserveAmount equal 10000000000000000000 ether (or a value will over the pool limit), sellCouponAmount equal totalBuyCouponAmount (e.g 100000000000000000000000);
2. attacker call endAuction();

### Impact

1. The entire auction can be “hijacked” unilaterally by a malicious bidder and declared a failure
Because the contract only checks the poolSaleLimit in endAuction(), and removes orders solely from the relatively lower-priced side, an extremely high bid can remain in the system until the final stage, pushing totalSellReserveAmount beyond the threshold. At that point, the malicious bidder can call endAuction(), immediately causing the auction to fail (FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT), thus invalidating every other participant’s bid.

2. Legitimate users’ bids are forced to become void, losing their chance to obtain the auction proceeds or underlying assets
A malicious bidder can submit a high-priced bid and end the auction within the same block or transaction, leaving normal participants no time to adjust their bids, thus depriving them of any opportunity to earn auction proceeds or acquire underlying assets.

3. The auction process may be permanently disrupted,all users will loss their bondtoken interests, far exceeding $10
If one auction fails in this manner, the required interest (totalBuyCouponAmount) for subsequent users will grow over time, further increasing the likelihood of future attacks. This effectively freezes the pool’s auction process and can lead to a mass sell-off of bondToken by repeated attack.To restore normal operations, the pool would be forced to significantly bolster its reserveToken balance, resulting in substantial losses for the project team.

4. Attacker's loss can similar be zero
The attacker's loss can similar be zero (attacker' cost only include transaction fee,and minner will not reject a high gas price transaction) because they can immediately withdraw their previously deposited funds after the auction fails, significantly increasing the feasibility of the attack.

### Mitigation

1.In the bid() function, restrict the user's input for buyReserveAmount to ensure it does not exceed sellReserveToken.balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit / 100.
