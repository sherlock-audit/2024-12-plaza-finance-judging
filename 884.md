# Insufficient fee tracking mechanism might cause the protocol to claim more/less fees.

### Summary

The  [Pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L700-L720) contract calculates fees using the current reserve token balance, which can be unfair:


```solidity
    function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
        return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime))
            / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
    }
```

If the token balance is low for most of a week, but suddenly increases right before claiming fees, the team gets more fees than they should.

The opposite can also happen - if the balance drops before claiming, the team gets fewer fees than earned.

This happens because the current method just looks at the token balance at the moment of fee calculation, which doesn't accurately represent the true value over time.

This means the fee calculation can be easily manipulated and doesn't fairly represent the pool's actual performance.

### Root Cause

The fees in  the `Pool` contract are tracked by using the `reserveToken::balanceOf`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The protocol might claim more/less fees depending on at which time they claim

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider checkpointing and internally accounting the fees on every contract interaction, to bring fair disitribution to both the protocol and the users.
