# No exitPreDepositAndBalancer functionality implemented

### Summary

There is no functionality to exit a PreDeposit position. If a user changes his mind and decides that he doesn't want to preDeposit anymore, there's no way for him to withdraw his funds. Although there is a `PreDeposit:Withdraw`, the implementation isn't correct.
A user predeposits via the `BalancerRouter:joinBalancerAndPredeposit`. He joins the balancer with an underlying whitelisted asset and gets some BLPs in return, it's the BLP amount that's passed as a parameter to the `PreDeposit:deposit`. 
The problem lies when a user wants to withdraw, he's given back the reserveToken, BLP, but there's no way for him to exit the balancerPool and get his underlying assets back as `BalancerRouter:exitBalancerPool` is internal and there's no functionality for `exitPreDepositAndBalancer`

### Root Cause

If a user changes their mind, there is no way for user to withdraw and get back his underlying assets after PreDepositing

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user predeposits via  `BalancerRouter:joinBalancerAndPredeposit`
2. A user changes his mind and opts to withdraw
3. He gets BLP back but can't exit Balancer to get his underlying assets


### Impact

The user gets stuck. 
  1. He wouldn't be able to joinPlaza even after the PreDeposit has ended and the pool has been created because there's no standalone joinPlaza functionality if you're already in Balancer
2. He wouldn't be able to get back the underlying assets because the `BalancerRouter:exitBalancerPool` and can't be called by him
3. He's therefore stuck in Balancer with no way out

<summary>Test</summary>

```javascript
function testCantExitPreDepositAndBalancer() public {
    vm.startPrank(user);

    IAsset[] memory assets = new IAsset[](2);
    assets[0] = IAsset(address(asset1));
    assets[1] = IAsset(address(asset2));

    uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn = new uint256[](2);
    maxAmountsIn[0] = 1 ether;
    maxAmountsIn[1] = 1 ether;

    asset1.approve(address(router), 1 ether);
    asset2.approve(address(router), 1 ether);

    uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = router.joinBalancerAndPredeposit(
      BALANCER_POOL_ID,
      address(predeposit),
      assets,
      maxAmountsIn,
      ""
    );

    assertEq(balancerPoolTokenReceived, 1 ether, "Incorrect balancerPoolToken amount received");
    assertEq(asset1.balanceOf(user), 999 ether, "Incorrect asset1 balance");
    assertEq(asset2.balanceOf(user), 999 ether, "Incorrect asset2 balance");

    predeposit.withdraw(balancerPoolTokenReceived);
    assertEq(Token(balancerPoolToken).balanceOf(user), balancerPoolTokenReceived);

    console2.log("User ends up with BLP with no way to get back his underlying assets through the router");

    vm.stopPrank();
  }
```
</details>


### Mitigation

Consider implementing a functionality to enable the user to exit balancer and get the underlying assets after withdrawing from PreDeposit or make the `PreDeposit:Withdraw` only callable by the balancerRouter and implement a `exitPreDepositAndBalancer` functionality
