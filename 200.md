# Imprecise slot size calculation will prevent auction completion.

### Summary

In the auction contract, the minimum bid amount (`slotSize`) is automatically calculated as `totalBuyCouponAmount / maxBids` when the auction starts. However, if `totalBuyCouponAmount % maxBids != 0`, the total bid amount cannot exactly match `totalBuyCouponAmount`, even when all available slots are filled. This prevents the auction from ending successfully, effectively locking it in an incomplete state..

### Root Cause

On the line [Auction.sol#L383](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L383), `slotSize` is calculated as `totalBuyCouponAmount / maxBids`.
If `totalBuyCouponAmount` is not divisible by `maxBids`, the resulting `slotSize` is rounded down, leaving a remainder.

Attacker can crowd out legitimate bids and fill the bid list with only his bids by creating bids with `sellCouponAmount=slotSize` and a very small `buyReserveAmount` (which makes the price very high because the `buyReserveAmount` is small).
In this case, bids count is `maxBids` and `currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

`couponAmountToDistribute` calculated on the line [Pool.sol#L549-L550](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L549-L550), is not a multiple of 1000.

### Attack Path

1. **Setup:**
   - Assume `totalBuyCouponAmount = 10001` and `maxBids = 1000`.
   - When the auction starts, the contract calculates:
     ```solidity
     slotSize = 10001 / 1000 = 10 (rounded down).
     ```

2. **Bidding Phase:**
   - Attacker can crowd out legitimate bids and fill the bid list with only his bids by creating a bid with a large ratio of `sellCouponAmount` to `buyReserveAmount` (choosing a small amount of `sellCouponAmount`).

3. **Auction Behavior:**
   - The total bid amount becomes `currentCouponAmount = 10 * 1000 = 10000`.
   - Since `currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount` (10001), the auction cannot end.

### Impact

Attacker uses a small amount of reserve tokens to prevent the auction from ending and then claims the reserve tokens again.

### Mitigation

When creating an auction, ensure that `totalBuyCouponAmount % maxBids = 0` is satisfied.
Or use `Round.up` while calculating `slotSize`.
