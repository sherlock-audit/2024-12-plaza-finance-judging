# Users can DOS the whole auction if they get USDC blacklisted

### Summary

Users can DOS an auction if they get blacklisted by USDC(which is in scope). This happens if an user(either a normal user or a malicious one) bids before the `maxBids` cap is reached or when there is some excess bids which need removal. Once an auction starts, bidders can join by bidding`coupons`(USDC) for reserve tokens. No matter how long the auction is, if the user gets blacklisted by USDC while the auction is still going, it will DOS the whole auction if the protocol tries to remove the user's bid. This could happen in 2 scenarios:
1. When a new bids happens and the `maxBid` is reached and user's bid is the current lowest bid:
```javascript
    if (bidCount > maxBids) {
      if (lowestBidIndex == newBidIndex) {
        revert BidAmountTooLow();
      }
      _removeBid(lowestBidIndex);
    }
```
2. If the user's bid is being removed by `Auction::removeExcessBids`
```javascript
function removeExcessBids() internal {
    if (currentCouponAmount <= totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      return;
    }

    uint256 amountToRemove = currentCouponAmount - totalBuyCouponAmount;
    uint256 currentIndex = lowestBidIndex;

    while (currentIndex != 0 && amountToRemove != 0) {
      // Cache the current bid's data into local variables
      Bid storage currentBid = bids[currentIndex];
      uint256 sellCouponAmount = currentBid.sellCouponAmount;
      uint256 prevIndex = currentBid.prevBidIndex;

      if (amountToRemove >= sellCouponAmount) {
        // Subtract the sellAmount from amountToRemove
        amountToRemove -= sellCouponAmount;

        // Remove the bid
@>   _removeBid(currentIndex);

        // Move to the previous bid (higher price)
        currentIndex = prevIndex;
      } else {
        // Calculate the proportion of sellAmount being removed
        uint256 proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount;
        
        // Reduce the current bid's amounts
        currentBid.sellCouponAmount = sellCouponAmount - amountToRemove;
        currentCouponAmount -= amountToRemove;

        uint256 reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18);
        currentBid.buyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount - reserveReduction;
        totalSellReserveAmount -= reserveReduction;
        
        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
@> IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
        
        amountToRemove = 0;
        emit BidReduced(currentIndex, currentBid.bidder, currentBid.buyReserveAmount, currentBid.sellCouponAmount);
      }
    }
  }
```
Both `Auction::_removeBid` and `Auction::removeExcessBids` use a `push` method to refund users their funds. If a user gets blacklisted(either by purpose or not) by USDC, a DOS will happen and funds will be stuck and lost.


### Internal Pre-conditions

`maxBids` needs to be reached or `currentCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount`


### Attack Path

1. Malicious user bids a very small amount of USDC on an auction(last or second to last position).
2. Malicious user gets himself blacklisted on USDC
3. `maxBids` or `currentCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount` is reached
4. Someone bids and Malicious user's bid needs to be excluded and the malicious user refunded
5. Refund couldn't happen because the malicious user is USDC backlisted
6. Whole contract goes DOS, all the funds of the other bidders gets stuck. 

This can happen even if the user is not malicious, but gets blacklisted by USDC.

### Impact

Stuck funds in `Auction.sol`

### Mitigation

Make users claim their refund instead of sending it to them.
