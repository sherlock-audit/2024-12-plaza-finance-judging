# Malicious actors will manipulate block timestamps to exploit payment timing in `MockMerchant`

### Summary

Reliance on `block.timestamp` for payment timing calculations will cause potential manipulation vulnerability for users as malicious miners can influence block timestamps to affect payment distribution timing.

### Root Cause

In src/MockMerchant.sol#40 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/MockMerchant.sol#L40), the code uses `block.timestamp` for comparing payment periods:
```solidity
poolInfo.lastDistribution + poolInfo.distributionPeriod < block.timestamp
```

This is problematic because `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners within certain bounds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to have active payment distribution periods configured
2. `poolInfo.lastDistribution` and `poolInfo.distributionPeriod` need to be set to valid values
3. Payment distribution timing needs to be dependent on the timestamp comparison

### External Pre-conditions

Miners need to have the ability to manipulate block timestamps (which they naturally do within certain bounds)

### Attack Path

1. Attacker (as a miner or by colluding with miners) observes payment distribution timing
2. Attacker manipulates `block.timestamp` to be slightly higher/lower than actual time. 
3. This manipulation can force payment distributions to occur earlier/later than intended
4. Multiple manipulations could lead to gaming of the payment system

### Impact

The protocol and users may experience incorrect payment timing, potentially leading to:

1. Premature payment distributions
2. Delayed payment distributions
3. Possible exploitation of price differences due to timing manipulation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Consider using block numbers instead of timestamps for timing-critical operations
2. Implement additional checks to ensure minimum time periods between distributions
3. Add grace periods to make timestamp manipulation less impactful
4. Consider using a time oracle for critical timing operations

While `block.timestamp` manipulation is limited (miners can only manipulate it within a few seconds typically), for high-value or time-sensitive operations, this could still present a risk. 

The severity is marked as Medium because:

1. The manipulation window is limited
2. The impact is generally financial but not catastrophic
3. Exploitation requires miner cooperation or mining capabilities
