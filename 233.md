# `endAuction` can be called an unlimited amount of time to drain the Pool's reserves.

## Bug description
When the auction succeed, `endAuction()` will be called to transfer reserves to the auction and transfer coupon tokens to the pool.

[Auction.sol#L337-L347](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L337-L347)
```solidity
if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();
if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
    state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
} else if (
    totalSellReserveAmount >=
    (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100
) {
    state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
} else {
    state = State.SUCCEEDED;
    Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(
        beneficiary,
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this))
    );
}
```

As we can see the condition for this function to succeed is for the auction to not be in the bidding state. However, the function does not check if it has already been called, which would allow an attacker to call the `endAuction()` function multiple times. When that happens, an amount of `totalSellReserveAmount` will be transferred from the pool to the auction again, while the auction will transfer its own balance of the coupon token to the pool, which will already be 0. Even though there won't be a way to claim reserve tokens that were transferred to the auction again, they will remain locked in the contract forever and the pool can be drained this way.

## Root cause
An ability to call `endAuction` multiple times for a completed auction.

## Attack path
1. Auction succeeded.
2. `endAuction` is called for the first time. It transfers coupon tokens obtained in the auction to the pool, which reduces its balance of the coupon token to 0. It also transfers `totalSellReserveAmount` of reserve tokens from the pool to the auction contract.
3. `endAuction` is called again, transferring its balance - which is 0 - to the pool and transferring `totalSellReserveAmount` of reserve tokens to the auction contract.
4. Reserve tokens are locked in the auction without a way to rescue them.

The above can be repeated multiple times until Pool is drained.

## Impact
Pool can be drain of reserves tokens, which will be locked in the auction contract without a way to rescue them.

## Recommended Mitigation
Ensure `endAuction()` can only be called once.
