# Minting bond tokens during the Auction will not leave enough coupon tokens for every user to claim

### Summary

The Auction begins in the assumption that there are a set number of shares, and to distribute among these shares it needs to know the exact count of bond token shares in the protocol.

It does so,

However once the Auction starts and if the user mints bond tokens, the coupon token to distribute wouldn't be enough for all Users.

### Root Cause

The protocol breaks an invariant that there is enough USDC coupons for every bond token minted, however this becomes false when the Bond tokens are minted during the Auction.


### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Auction starts and mints coupons based on Bond Token total supply and shares per token.
2. New User mints bond Token
3. Auction Ends
4. User now has shares that he mints available in `getIndexedUserAmount`, however coupons for this weren't minted
5. Everyone starts claiming coupons
6. Some victim is left unable to as there aren't enough coupons.

### Impact

Some User(s) are left without any coupons to claim

### PoC

### Mitigation

Adjust max coupon sold in Auction dynamically or restrict minting/burning of Bond tokens during the Auction.
