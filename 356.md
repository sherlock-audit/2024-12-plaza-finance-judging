# PreDeposit Can Be Initialized by Attackers

### Summary

The `PreDeposit` contract is responsible for registering user balances before the launch of a Pool. However, due to its upgradeable nature, if the contract is upgraded while holding funds, an attacker could initialize the contract with altered data to drain the balance.

### Root Cause

* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L84

An attacker can initialize a newly upgraded contract. If the contract holds user funds, these funds could be drained.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* The contract is upgraded for some reason.

* User funds are held within the contract.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The contract is upgraded.

2. The attacker initializes the contract and gains ownership.

3. The attacker deploys a new implementation.

4. The attacker withdraws all the funds held by PreDeposit.

### Impact

Loss of user funds.
