# The protocol sacrifices excessive totalSellReserveAmount due to fluctuating pool reserves during the auction period.

### Summary

The fluctuating `IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool)` during the auction period can lead to excessive `totalSellReserveAmount` being transferred to the auction upon success. This happens because the `poolSaleLimit` is applied to the reserve balance at the end of the auction, which may have increased significantly due to `create()` operations. Without a mechanism to tie `poolSaleLimit` to the reserve balance at the time of auction creation, the protocol risks depleting reserves inefficiently, especially when successful bids generally exhibit lower implied prices.

### Root Cause

The choice to dynamically associate the `poolSaleLimit` with the reserve balance at the time of auction success is a design oversight. It fails to account for fluctuations in pool reserves caused by operations like `create()` and `redeem()`, leading to unintended reserve depletion.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction Creation:

- The auction is initialized with `totalBuyCouponAmount` calculated based on the current `bondToken.totalSupply()` and `sharesPerToken`.
- The pool reserve balance `IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool)` is captured implicitly but not tied to the `poolSaleLimit`.
2. Reserve Fluctuations During Auction:

- The pool reserve balance increases significantly due to `create()` operations.
3. Auction Success:

- When `currentCouponAmount == totalBuyCouponAmount`, the auction succeeds.
- The protocol transfers `totalSellReserveAmount` to the auction, calculated from accepted bids, even if those bids result in poor implied prices.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Market activity results in increased demand for reserve tokens, leading to `create()` operations during the auction period.
2. No significant `redeem()` activity occurs to counteract the increase in reserves.

### Attack Path

Hereâ€™s how it plays out:

1. The auction is initialized with [`couponAmountToDistribute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L545-L550) (equal to [`totalBuyCouponAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L96)).
2. Bidders monitor the state of the auction and place bids at marginally better implied prices throughout the auction period  especially near the end, which is highly feasible due to the open bid design that I have addressed in a separate issue/report.
3. As the reserve balance increases due to `create()` operations, 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L242-L243

```solidity
    // Take reserveToken from user
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), depositAmount);
```
the protocol allows a higher `totalSellReserveAmount` to be sacrificed to the bidders while still adhering to the `poolSaleLimit`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341-L347

```solidity
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```
7. Upon auction success, the protocol transfers excessive `totalSellReserveAmount` than intended to the auction, depleting its reserves inefficiently.

### Impact

The protocol sacrifices an excessive amount of `sellReserveToken` due to higher reserve balances at the time of auction success. The affected party is the protocol itself, which:

- Suffers economic inefficiency by depleting reserves unnecessarily.

- Faces reduced sustainability for future auctions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Tie poolSaleLimit to Initial Reserve Balance:

- Capture the `IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool)` at the time of `startAuction()` and use it to enforce `poolSaleLimit` throughout the auction period.
2. Set a Minimum Implied Price Threshold:

- Impose a dynamic minimum implied price to ensure bids offering poor value are rejected.
3. Cap Total Reserve Sacrifice:

- Introduce an explicit cap on `totalSellReserveAmount` relative to `totalBuyCouponAmount`.

Note: If the pool reserve balance decreases significantly during the auction, tying `poolSaleLimit` to the initial balance might restrict the auction unnecessarily. This drawback can/will be handled as a separate issue/report to maintain modularity and focus on improving reserve management dynamics.
