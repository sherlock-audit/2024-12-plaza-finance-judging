# Excess bids cannot be removed in `Auction.removeExcessBids` if address is USDC blacklisted

# Summary

Excess bids cannot be removed from lowest bids if address is blacklisted by USDC in `Auction.removeExcessBids`.

## Vulnerability Details

In `Auction.bid`, whenever a new bidder bids, Auction contract will attempt to remove any excess bids starting from the lowest bids if the `currentCouponAmount` used by bidders exceeds the maximum `totalBuyCouponAmount` allowed.

The problem is that if a user has been blacklisted by USDC, the protocol will not be able to remove excess bids as `Auction.removeExcessBids` will revert.

```solidity
  function removeExcessBids() internal {
      ...
      else {
        // Calculate the proportion of sellAmount being removed
        uint256 proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount;

        // Reduce the current bid's amounts
        currentBid.sellCouponAmount = sellCouponAmount - amountToRemove;
        currentCouponAmount -= amountToRemove;

        uint256 reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18);
        currentBid.buyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount - reserveReduction;
        totalSellReserveAmount -= reserveReduction;

        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove); // @audit reverts is bidder is USDC blacklisted

        amountToRemove = 0;
        emit BidReduced(currentIndex, currentBid.bidder, currentBid.buyReserveAmount, currentBid.sellCouponAmount);
      }
     ...
  }
```

## Impact

Bidders will not be able to place a higher bid since removal of excess bids cannot go through as long as one of the bidders in the lowest bids is blacklisted by USDC

## Mitigation

Consider using internal accounting to store the amount of coupon token that should be refunded to the lowest bidders in a mapping, together with a separate function to allow lowest bidders to claim the amount of coupon token that was pushed out by a higher bidder.
