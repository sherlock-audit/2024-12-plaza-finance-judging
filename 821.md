# Users can force auctions to fail by redeeming large amounts right before auction ends

### Summary

Users can force auctions to fail by redeeming large amounts right before auction ends.



### Root Cause

Pool sale limit depends on the current `BOND` total supply, and when auction ends, there is a check to ensure that pool has enough reserve tokens to transfer. Malicious user can before start of auction first call `create()` with large reserve amount to inflate `BOND` total supply (and pool sale limit also), next call `startAuction()` and right before auction ends, he/she can withdraw all deposited reserve to force auction to fail.

```solidity
} else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

Large amounts of reserve tokens should be witdrawed before auction ends. It can happed naturally, but also it can be abused by attaker, and no need to rely on frontrunning, because `endAuction()` is permissined and can be called by anyone if `block.timestamp >= endTime`.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Some details are omitted for simplicity:
1. Balance of pool = 50e18 reserve tokens;
2. Amelie deposits 100e18 reserve tokens to a pool a creates an auction, balanse of pool = 150e18, pool sale limit = 135e18 (90%);
3. Users place bids, `totalSellReserveAmount` of auction = 120e18, bidders expects to receive their legitimate reserve tokens;
4. When `block.timestamp >= endTime`, user withdraws 100e18 reserve tokens, now pool sale limit = 45e18 (90%), and calls `endAuction()`;
5. Auction fails, state = `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`.

### Impact

Users may redeem during ongoing auction to decrease reserve balance in order to force auction to fail.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not use `balanceOf()` to determine pool sale limit because it can be manipulated, also it's recommended to add withdrawal fee and cooldown period.
