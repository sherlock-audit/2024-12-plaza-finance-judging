# Flash loan can be used to breach PoolSaleLimit in auctions

## Description
When `endAuction()` function is called, [it relies on pool balance of reserve tokens to verify if `poolSaleLimit` is breached](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341):
```js
    else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } 
```

Since it is an `external` function which can be called by anyone, a flash loan (or own funds) can be used to trick the protocol into thinking that `totalSellReserveAmount` has not surpassed `poolSaleLimit`. Consider the following:
1. Suppose `poolSaleLimit = 95%` and poolReserves or balance of reserveTokens in the pool = `900,000`.
2. Let's consider `totalSellReserveAmount` at end of auction is `860,000`.
4. `endAuction()` should revert if `totalSellReserveAmount` >= `900,000 * 95% = 855,000`, which it is.
5. Attacker takes a flash loan of `100,000` to deposit reserves & `create()` some tokens. Then calls `endAuction()`. Protocol sees that `totalSellReserveAmount` is less than `1000,000 * 95% = 950,000` and hence does not revert. Attacker then calls `redeem()` and returns the flash loan.

Also, it's worth noting that although Base has a [private mempool](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences#mempool-rules) (visible only to the Sequencer) so deliberate front-running is not an option but it could happen naturally that the attacker's `endAuction()` call executes before others (attacker can also attempt to offer a considerable high fee to increase their chances).

## Impact
- Greater than the safe limit of `poolSaleLimit` can be auctioned off, thus reducing the overall balance of reserveTokens the protocol wished to maintain.
- This could even cause CL to go below threshold thus offering the attacker to mint new tokens at a discounted rate.

## Mitigation 
A few ways to mitigate this would be:
1. Use a Time-Weighted Average Reserve (TWAR) instead of current balance.
2. Add a timelock on `endAuction()` by adding a `requestEndAuction()` function. One needs to call `requestEndAuction()` first & the auction ends and balances are stored in storage variables. Then an hour (or a day) later, `endAuction()` can be called which relies on the previously saved balances.
