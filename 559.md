# Plaza Finance Could Return Incorrect Prices for Underlying Tokens Due to Chainlink MinAnswer Circuit Breaker

### Summary

Chainlink aggregators have built-in `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` circuit breakers that trigger when prices go outside a predetermined range. This can lead to incorrect pricing if an asset's value falls below the `minAnswer`. For example, in the case of a drastic drop in the price of wstETH or cbBTC, Plaza Finance might use the `minAnswer` instead of the asset's actual price, resulting in incorrect valuations. Users could exploit this discrepancy to borrow against these assets at inflated valuations, potentially causing financial harm to the protocol.

### Root Cause

Plaza Finance relies on Chainlink oracles to fetch token prices. Here's an example of the issue for wstETH/ETH:  

1. The price feed for wstETH/ETH on Base is located at:  
   [wstETH/ETH Price Feed Contract](https://basescan.org/address/0x43a5C292A453A3bF3606fa856197f09D7B74251a)  

2. Using [the provided process](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78558661/which-chainlinks-price-feeds-still-have-minanswer-and-maxanswer-checks) to check the feed's aggregator:  
   - Navigate to the "Read Contract" section of the price feed.  
   - Click on the `aggregator` function to retrieve the underlying aggregator contract address:  
     [Aggregator Contract](https://basescan.org/address/0xA5925A27D3281198c0ae60a5eFcD6C44A5e47526#code)  

3. Inspect the `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` fields on the aggregator contract.

For the wstETH/ETH price feed, the `minAnswer` is set to a specific value, confirming that a lower bound exists. This introduces the risk of returning the `minAnswer` during drastic price drops, instead of the actual asset value. You can see this by copy pasting the following URL in your browser: https://basescan.org/address/0xA5925A27D3281198c0ae60a5eFcD6C44A5e47526#code#F8#L57

A similar issue exists for the cbBTC token. The cbBTC price feed can be analyzed using the same process outlined above. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

Plaza Finance must depend on Chainlink price feeds for token valuations as it indeed does.

### External Pre-conditions

The price of the underlying token (e.g., wstETH, cbBTC) must drop drastically below the `minAnswer` value. 

### Attack Path

1. A token’s price drops significantly below the `minAnswer` set by the Chainlink aggregator.  
2. The oracle continues to return the `minAnswer` as the token’s value.  
3. Users borrow against the asset using its inflated price.  
4. Plaza Finance suffers financial harm as the actual value of the collateral is far below the recorded price.  

### Impact

The protocol could suffer severe financial harm

### PoC

I'm attaching screenshot to showcase the presence of minAnswer in wstETH price feed as well.

### Mitigation

OracleReader should check the returned answer against the minPrice/maxPrice and revert if the answer is outside of the bounds:

```diff 
(, int256 answer,, uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();

+ if (answer >= maxPrice or answer <= minPrice) revert();

```
