# Coupon tokens stuck in PreDeposit contract

### Summary

A forgotten `claim()` call before the start of the first (or more) auction will cause a loss of coupon tokens for the affected users, as the PreDeposit contract will hold the undistributed tokens without a way to retrieve them.

### Root Cause

The coupon token distribution mechanism, implemented in the `BondToken` contract, updates user balances through the `_update()` function ), which subsequently calls `updateIndexedUserAssets()`. This function increments `userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares` based on the `getIndexedUserAmount()` calculation. This calculation considers the user's balance and the current period.

* [`_update()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154)
* [`updateIndexedUserAssets()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L172)
* [`getIndexedUserAmount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L190)

However, if a user doesn't call the `claim()` function in the `PreDeposit` contract before the first (or more) `startAuction()`, the `indexedAmountShares` will be updated for the `PreDeposit` contract's address (as it holds the tokens), but not for the individual user.  This results in the user's coupon balance remaining zero, effectively losing their entitled tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. At least one user must have deposited tokens into the `PreDeposit` contract, but not called the `claim()` function before the first (or more) `startAuction()` function was called.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User deposit tokens into the `PreDeposit` contract.
2. Users do not call `claim()` before the first (or more) `startAuction()` call.
3. User call `claim()` 
4. Coupon token are allocated to `PreDeposit` contract address
5. User receive zero coupon tokens

### Impact

Affected users cannot claim their coupon tokens. The tokens remain stuck in the `PreDeposit` contract, resulting in a loss of funds for the users. 

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Allow a governance-controlled address to retrieve the stuck tokens, or distribute unclaimed coupons retroactively when users eventually call `claim()` after the first auction. However, the second option increase the complexity of `claim()`.
