# Starting auction can be DOS

### Summary

The [stratAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530) will be DOS.

### Root Cause

The function [checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L535) whether or not the `auction period` has passed, but this check is problematic for this type of function, if user or anybody failed to call the `startAuction` during the the `auctionPeriod`, the function would be DOS 

```solidity
pool.sol

530:  function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
531:    // Check if distribution period has passed
532:    require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod < block.timestamp, DistributionPeriodNotPassed());

534:    // Check if auction period hasn't passed
535: @>    require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users or anybody failing to call the function during the `auctionPeriod`

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Pool is deployed 
2. now the `auctionPeriod` is set to 3 days to say
3. Users or anybody failing to call the [startAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530) during that 3 days will DOS the function

### Impact

1. The starting auction for that period would be DOS.
2. No coupon tokens will be distributed to bond holders for that period
3. Bond holders effectively lose their yield for that period



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

This can be handle by implementing Keeper bots to handle the function call withing the `auctionPeriod`.
