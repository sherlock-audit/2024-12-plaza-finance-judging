### Summary

USDC Blacklist Breaks Auction Settlement and Claims
Title
Critical Settlement Failure Due to USDC Blacklist in Auction Settlement and Claims

Severity
HIGH - Complete loss of funds and broken settlement mechanism

Description
The auction's settlement and claim processes can be permanently disrupted if the beneficiary address or winning bidders are USDC blacklisted, leading to locked funds and failed settlements.

The vulnerability exists in two critical settlement functions:

Auction Settlement:
function endAuction() external onlyPool {
    // ... state checks
    if (state == State.SUCCEEDED) {
        // Transfer all collected USDC to beneficiary
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }



as you can see this function directly transfers winner the winning amount if the bidder gets blacklisted after bidding this will cause a revert and failed auctions
