# Blacklisted bidders can force auction to pay them a very high price

### Summary

When a low bid is removed, the funds are sent back to the bidder. In the event that that bidder has become blacklisted then all subsequent bids will fail. In this case the reserve token will be sold at a very low price causing loss of funds to the pool.

[Auction.sol#L298-L331](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L298-L331)

        function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {

            ... SNIP

            // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
    @>      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);

            emit BidRemoved(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);

            delete bids[bidIndex];
            bidCount--;
        }

When a bidder is blacklisted _removeBid will revert during the transfer.

[Auction.sol#L250-L292](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L250-L292)

        function removeExcessBids() internal {
            
            ... SNIP

            if (amountToRemove >= sellCouponAmount) {
                // Subtract the sellAmount from amountToRemove
                amountToRemove -= sellCouponAmount;

                // Remove the bid
    @>          _removeBid(currentIndex);

                // Move to the previous bid (higher price)
                currentIndex = prevIndex;
            } else {

                ... SNIP
                
                // Refund the proportional sellAmount
    @>          IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
                
                amountToRemove = 0;
                emit BidReduced(currentIndex, currentBid.bidder, currentBid.buyReserveAmount, currentBid.sellCouponAmount);
            }
            }
        }

In the event that there are excess bids, removeExcessBids will be called to clear the excess bids. We see that if the bidder is blacklisted then this becomes impossible. As a result all additional calls to make bids will revert.

### Root Cause

[Auction.sol#L286](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L286) and [Auction.sol#L325](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L325) send funds directly to bidder


### Internal preconditions

None

### External preconditions

Bidder is blacklisted

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Auction will complete a price much lower than market price

### POC

N/A

### Mitigation

Instead of transferring directly it should populate a mapping and allow the user to claim
