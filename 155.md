# Incorrect logic for calculation of shares in `BondToken::getIndexedUserAmount`.

### Summary
The function `getIndexedUserAmount()` calculates shares for each iteration as -

```js
shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
```
The issue - 
1. for this calculation the `balance` is considered constant for each period or each iteration.
2. But there could be possibility that `balance` of user at different periods is different.
3. In that scenario, the above formula is incorrect as it considers balance of user at every period constant.
### Root Cause
Consider that balance of user is constant throughout each period.

### Impact
Incorrect shares calculation, `getIndexedUserAmount()` is called in `Distributor.sol::claim()` function, if incorrect shares is being fetched user will claim unexpected amount, leading to loss of funds to either protocol or user itself.

### Mitigation

Implemenation something like below will be more accurate, i.e. storing and fecthing from mapping of user and period -

```js
shares += (balanceofUserAtEachPeriod[user][i] * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
```
