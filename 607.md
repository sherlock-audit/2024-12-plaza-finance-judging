# Dust tokens stuck in BalancerRouter during joinBalancerPool

### Summary

A missing return of unused tokens in `joinBalancerPool` will cause a loss of dust tokens for users interacting with the `BalancerRouter` as the contract will retain any unused portion of the `maxAmountsIn` after a join operation.


### Root Cause

In [`joinBalancerPool`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L61), the contract transfers `maxAmountsIn` of each token from the user and approves the Balancer Vault to spend this amount.  The Balancer V2 documentation ([Pool Joins](https://docs-v2.balancer.fi/reference/joins-and-exits/pool-joins.html#arguments-explained)) states the following regarding `maxAmountsIn`:

> maxAmountsIn - Maximum token send amounts

However, the Balancer Vault's `joinPool` function may not consume the entire approved amount. The `joinBalancerPool` function does not account for this and does not return any unused tokens to the user, resulting in these "dust" amounts being stuck in the `BalancerRouter` contract.


### Internal Pre-conditions

* User needs to call `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` or `joinBalancerAndPlaza` to initiate a join operation to the Balancer pool.
* The calculated amount of tokens required for the join operation by the Balancer Vault is less than the `maxAmountsIn` provided by the user.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User calls `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` or `joinBalancerAndPlaza` with a specified `maxAmountsIn` for each token.
2. `joinBalancerPool` transfers `maxAmountsIn` from the user to the `BalancerRouter` and approves the Balancer Vault.
3. Balancer Vault's `joinPool` is called.  It consumes less than `maxAmountsIn` of one or more tokens.
4. `joinBalancerPool` does not return the unused tokens to the user, and they remain stuck in the `BalancerRouter` contract.

### Impact

The user suffers a loss of the unused portion of the `maxAmountsIn` for each token. This amount can be considered dust. Over time, the accumulated dust across multiple users could represent a significant amount.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

After the `balancerVault.joinPool` call, calculate the difference between the initial `maxAmountsIn` and the remaining balance of each token in the `BalancerRouter`. Transfer this difference back to the user.  A more gas-efficient approach would be to query the Vault for the actual amounts used in the join, but this requires a more complex integration with the `Vault`.
