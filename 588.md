# Time-Based Fee Deduction Causes Disproportionate Redeemable Amounts for Different Users

### Summary

The root cause is that time-based fee deductions reduce the pool reserves globally without accounting for when users minted their tokens. This results in disproportionate redeemable amounts for users, as earlier minters redeem a higher share of the pool reserves, leaving later minters with less.

### Root Cause

The choice to apply global time-based fee deductions to the pool reserves is a mistake, as it does not track individual user contributions or redemption times. This design penalizes users who redeem later, regardless of their token share.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

1. The time-based fee deduction must accumulate over time, reducing the pool reserves.
2. Users must attempt to redeem their tokens at different times, with significant intervals between minting and redemption.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The affected users suffer unequal treatment in their redeemable amounts:

User 1 (earlier minter) redeems more than their fair share of the pool reserves.
User 2 (later minter) redeems less than their fair share. This creates a fairness issue and could result in user dissatisfaction or loss of trust in the protocol.

### PoC

Following PoC test proves that:

```solidity
    function testCreateRedeemOnDifferentBlockTimestamp() public {
        vm.startPrank(governance);
        Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);
        
        Pool.TokenType assetType = Pool.TokenType.LEVERAGE;
        uint256 inAmount = 1000;
        uint256 ethPrice = 0;
        uint256 TotalUnderlyingAssets = 32000;
        uint256 DebtAssets = 2100000;
        uint256 LeverageAssets = 1200000;

        rToken.mint(governance, TotalUnderlyingAssets + inAmount);
        rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), TotalUnderlyingAssets);

        string memory salt = "random";
        params.fee = 100000;
        // Create pool and approve deposit amount
        Pool _pool = Pool(
            poolFactory.createPool(
                params,
                TotalUnderlyingAssets,
                DebtAssets,
                LeverageAssets,
                "",
                salt,
                "",
                "",
                false
            )
        );

        useMockPool(address(_pool));

        vm.stopPrank();


        console.log("fee", _pool.fee());
        console.log("lastFeeClaimTime", _pool.lastFeeClaimTime());

        vm.startPrank(user);
        rToken.mint(user, inAmount);
        rToken.approve(address(_pool), inAmount);
        
        uint256 amount = _pool.create(
            assetType,
            inAmount,
            0
        );
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user);
        // vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);
        uint256 redeemAmount = _pool.redeem(
            assetType,
            amount,
            0
        );

        vm.stopPrank();


        // 187500
        console.log("Amount: ", amount);
        // 891 -> if we redeem directly
        // 802 -> if we redeem after 1 year passed
        console.log("Redeem Amount: ", redeemAmount);
    }
```

### Mitigation

For example use snapshot-based accounting:
Take snapshots of the reserves and token supplies when users mint tokens. Use these snapshots to calculate redeemable amounts fairly during redemption.
