# Flash Loan Exploit on `endAuction()` Function

### **Summary and Impact**

The `endAuction()` function within the `Auction.sol` contract is susceptible to manipulation through flash loan attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by temporarily inflating the pool's balance of the reserve token using a flash loan. This manipulation forces the auction to transition into a `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` state, even if the auction conditions were otherwise favorable. As a result, legitimate bidders are unable to claim their purchased assets, leading to potential financial losses and undermining the protocol's reliability.

While the vulnerability does not directly drain funds from the contract, it disrupts the auction mechanism's integrity, preventing rightful participants from accessing their entitlements. Given the protocol's reliance on accurate balance assessments to determine auction outcomes, this flaw poses a significant risk to the system's core functionality and user trust.

### **Vulnerability Details**

#### **Description**

The vulnerability arises from the way the `endAuction()` function calculates whether the auction has met the required sale limits. Specifically, it relies on the pool's **instantaneous** balance of the reserve token (`sellReserveToken`) to determine the auction state. This approach is vulnerable to manipulation via flash loans, where an attacker can temporarily boost the pool's balance within a single transaction to force the auction into a failed state.

#### **Impact**

- **Disruption of Auction Success**: Legitimate auctions can be forced to fail, preventing users from claiming their purchased assets.
- **Loss of Trust**: Users may lose confidence in the protocol's reliability and fairness.
- **Potential Financial Losses**: Although funds are not directly drained, users are unable to access their assets, leading to indirect financial impacts.

#### **Test Code Snippet**

```solidity
function testFlashLoanAttackEndAuction() external {
    // Check initial state
    assertEq(uint(auction.state()), 0, "Auction state should be BIDDING initially");

    // Attacker obtains flash loan. We'll just mint tokens to attacker for demonstration.
    reserveToken.mint(attacker, attackerFlashLoan);

    // Attacker inflates the pool's balance by transferring in the borrowed tokens
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    reserveToken.transfer(address(pool), attackerFlashLoan);

    // Now the pool's balance is artificially huge at the time of endAuction()
    // endAuction() checks if totalSellReserveAmount >= (poolBalance * poolSaleLimit) / 100
    // Since poolBalance is extremely large, the condition triggers auction failure

    auction.endAuction();
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Auction should be in state FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT
    assertEq(uint(auction.state()), 3, "Auction state should be FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT");

    // Attackers return their flash loan
    vm.prank(attacker);
    reserveToken.transfer(attacker, 0); // or do nothing if minted
}
```

#### **Exploit Mechanics**

1. **Flash Loan Acquisition**: The attacker borrows a substantial amount of the reserve token (`sellReserveToken`) using a flash loan.
2. **Balance Manipulation**: The attacker transfers the borrowed reserve tokens into the pool, temporarily inflating its balance.
3. **Auction Finalization**: The attacker invokes the `endAuction()` function. Due to the inflated pool balance, the condition:
   ```solidity
   totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100
   ```
   evaluates to `true`, transitioning the auction state to `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`.
4. **Flash Loan Repayment**: The attacker repays the flash loan within the same transaction, restoring the pool's balance.
5. **Outcome**: Legitimate bidders are unable to claim their assets as the auction is marked as failed, despite meeting the necessary criteria under normal conditions.

### **Recommendations**

**Time-Weighted Average Balance (TWAB)**:
   - **Implementation**: Replace the instantaneous balance check with a time-weighted average balance. This approach smoothens out short-term fluctuations in the pool's balance, making it resistant to manipulation via flash loans.
   - **Benefit**: Prevents attackers from significantly altering the pool's perceived balance within a single transaction, as the TWAB requires sustained balance levels over a defined period.

2. **Introduce a Delay or Challenge Period**:
   - **Implementation**: After `endAuction()` is invoked, introduce a mandatory delay before finalizing the auction state. During this period, implement a mechanism where any participant can challenge suspicious balance manipulations.
   - **Benefit**: Provides an opportunity to detect and revert malicious actions that attempt to manipulate the auction outcome, ensuring the integrity of the auction process.
