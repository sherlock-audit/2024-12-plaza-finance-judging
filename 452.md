# Payments from failed auctions can be claimed leading to indefinite DOS on other legitimate claims

### Summary

As soon as an auction is started, the globalPool struct is updated which credits users immediately with the the coupon tokens for that period. The issue is that distributor#couponAmountToDistribute is not updated until after the auction succeeds. Due to this issue an auction the fails will still be claimable by users. The issue is that those funds will not be present in the distributor. As a result, the distributor will run out of funds and legitimate claims will be DOS'd indefinitely.

### Root Cause

[BondToken.sol#L195](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L195) credits bond holders with coupons before the auction has finished

### Internal preconditions

Auction fails

### External preconditions

None

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

A failed auction with permanently DOS legitimate coupon claims

### POC

Tests for all vulnerabilities can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/IAm0x52/05589415ce45af83aa4f7a5f63afbf45).

Insert the following test into Pool.t.sol

    function testUndersoldAuctionRewardsCanStillBeClaimed() public {
        //test setup
        Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);
        Token cToken = Token(params.couponToken);

        Pool.TokenType bondTokenType = Pool.TokenType(0);

        rToken.mint(governance, 1e20);
        vm.prank(governance);
        rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 1e20);

        string memory salt = "test";
        PoolFactory.PoolParams memory _params = params;
        
        // create pool
        vm.prank(governance);
        Pool _pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(_params, 1e20, 1e20, 1e20, "", salt, "", "", false));

        vm.prank(governance);
        _pool.setAuctionPeriod(365 days);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);

        _pool.startAuction();

        address auction = _pool.auctions(0);

        vm.warp(Auction(auction).endTime());

        Auction(auction).endAuction();

        assert(Auction(auction).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD);

        // user is still owed coupon tokens even though the auction failed and there is no coupon tokens
        console.log(_pool.bondToken().getIndexedUserAmount(user, _pool.bondToken().balanceOf(governance), 1));
    }

    Output:
    [PASS] testUndersoldAuctionRewardsCanStillBeClaimed() (gas: 3853595)
    Logs:
