# BalancerRouter.sol does not return excess user funds at certain conditions.

### Summary

When depositing to PreDeposit.sol through ```BalancerRouter.sol.joinBalancerAndPredeposit``` at certain conditions(```reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap```)), excess amount is not returned to the user.

### Root Cause

Users can enter the protocol through BalancerRouter.sol, which simplifies the process. ```joinBalancerAndPredeposit``` function is for users that want to  join into the Balancer pools to get the reserve token and using them to deposit into the protocol to later mint `bondToken `and `leverageToken` in one call. 
The issues arises in  case the `reserveAmount ` is close to `reserveCap` in `PreDeposit` contract and the amount user is depositing exceeds the cap. The reservetoken  ```amount```  is adjusted and transferred from the `msg.sender` which is BalancerRouter contract. Since user is interacting though the BalancerRouter.sol the remainder will be left on that contract instead of being returned to the user. The result is the user is accounted less amount than they sent and the difference is left on the BalancerRouter.sol contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

`reserveAmount ` is close to `reserveCap`

### External Pre-conditions

User interacting through the BalancerRouter.sol contract. 

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Loss of user funds at certain conditions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Since `PreDeposit.deposit` contract does not return any values, balance change check inside the `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` call can be implemented.
