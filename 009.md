# Storage Collision Exploit in Upgradeable Contracts Due to Missing Storage Gap

### Summary

Implementations  contracts like `Auction.sol` and others lacks a reserved storage gap, which is crucial for upgradeable contracts. Without this gap, new storage variables added during future upgrades may overwrite existing variables, leading to unintended behavior, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit this oversight by manipulating storage during upgrades to cause unpredictable or malicious outcomes. Properly reserving a storage gap in the contract's layout is essential to prevent storage collisions and ensure safe upgrades.
