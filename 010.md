# Re-entrancy  exploit attack

### Summary

The `Auction.sol::_removeBid()` function is vulnerable to a re-entrancy attack due to an external call to `IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer` made before fully updating the contract's state. A malicious bidder contract can exploit this by re-entering the function (or related functions) and manipulating the contract's state while it is in an inconsistent state.

### Root Cause

```solidity

    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
 @>   IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount); // @audit re-entrancy attack

    emit BidRemoved(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);

    // Update state
 @>   delete bids[bidIndex];
 @>  bidCount--;

```

### Impact

Attack Setup: An attacker creates a malicious contract that calls `Auction.sol::_removeBid()` and re-enters the function during the execution of the `safeTransfer` call.
Triggering the Attack:
The attacker bids in the auction, triggering a bid removal when their bid is no longer the highest or lowest.
When the contract attempts to refund tokens using the safeTransfer call, the attackerâ€™s malicious contract is called.
The malicious contract, in its fallback function, re-enters the vulnerable `_removeBid()` function.

Legitimate Bids are Not Removed: The linked list might not update, meaning bids that should be removed from the auction remain, invalidating the auction process.
Invalid Bids are Accepted: A malicious actor could manipulate the bid list to make invalid bids appear as the highest or lowest bid, disrupting the auction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity

// Update state before external calls
delete bids[bidIndex];
bidCount--;

// Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);

```
