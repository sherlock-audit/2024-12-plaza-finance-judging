# [0xgh0st] - A malicious bidder could manipulate the auction contract to buy reserve amount with the lowest price

### Summary

Bidders can use coupon tokens through the Auction contract to purchase the underlying reserve assets. When bidders place a bid, they will send sellCouponAmount amount of coupon tokens to the Auction contract. If the number of bids exceeds the maxBids or if the total amount of coupon tokens paid by bidders is greater than totalBuyCouponAmount, the contract will remove some low-priced bids and return the coupon tokens paid to the bidder.
```solidity
  function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns(uint256) {
    if (sellCouponAmount == 0 || sellCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (buyReserveAmount == 0) revert BidAmountTooLow();
    if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh();

    // Transfer buy tokens to contract
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sellCouponAmount);

    Bid memory newBid = Bid({
      bidder: msg.sender,
      buyReserveAmount: buyReserveAmount,
      sellCouponAmount: sellCouponAmount,
      nextBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the end of the list
      prevBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the start of the list
      claimed: false
    });

    lastBidIndex++; // Avoids 0 index
    uint256 newBidIndex = lastBidIndex;
    bids[newBidIndex] = newBid;
    bidCount++;

    // Insert the new bid into the sorted linked list
    insertSortedBid(newBidIndex);
    currentCouponAmount += sellCouponAmount;
    totalSellReserveAmount += buyReserveAmount;

    if (bidCount > maxBids) {
      if (lowestBidIndex == newBidIndex) {
        revert BidAmountTooLow();
      }
      _removeBid(lowestBidIndex); <@audit
    }

    // Remove and refund out of range bids
    removeExcessBids(); <@audit

    // Check if the new bid is still on the map after removeBids
    if (bids[newBidIndex].bidder == address(0)) {
      revert BidAmountTooLow();
    }

    emit BidPlaced(newBidIndex,msg.sender, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);

    return newBidIndex;
  }
```
the attacker can get leverage by taking flashloan and place multiple bids until reaching the maxBids, and before calling `endAuction()` he can `claimRefund` of all previous bids and place a new one with the lowest sell amount.

### Root Cause

The unlimited number of bids made by a single user

### Attack Path

1. An attacker gets a flashloan.
2. The attacker place multiple bids with the higher prices until reaching max.
3. The attacker remove all bids before calling `endAuction()`.
4. The attacker place a new bid with the lowest price.
5. The attacker  ends the auction and claim the reserve tokens.

### Impact

An attacker could drain coupon tokens in the pool contract. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I think you should restrict the number of bids made by a single user.
