# Bidders may lose their claims in `Auction.claimBid()`

### Summary

the IERC20 `transfer()` function returns a Boolean indicates whether the transfer succeed,
the missing check in `Auction.claimBid()` will cause a loss of funds for the bidders if the auction succeeds and the transfer fails
`bidInfo.buyReserveAmount` as this amount will be stuck in the auction contract.

### Root Cause

in the `Auction.claimBid()`  there is no check for the Boolean that indicates whether the transfer succeeds

### Internal Pre-conditions

this may happen if the auction succeeds, and the transfer fails.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

An amount of reserve token equal to `bidInfo.buyReserveAmount` will be stuck inside the `Auction.sol` contract with no way out

### PoC

The ERC-20 spec defines the functions with a bool success return value. Reverting when an operation like transfer fails is specified as a "SHOULD" behavior, i.e. it's a recommendation and not strictly required by the spec. A compliant implementation could return false if the operation failed, and you want to catch that.

### Mitigation

implement the `claimBid()` as follow:
```solidity
  function claimBid(uint256 bidIndex) auctionExpired auctionSucceeded whenNotPaused external {
    Bid storage bidInfo = bids[bidIndex];
    if (bidInfo.bidder != msg.sender) revert NothingToClaim();
    if (bidInfo.claimed) revert AlreadyClaimed();

    bidInfo.claimed = true;
    IERC20(sellReserveToken).safeTransfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);

    emit BidClaimed(bidIndex, bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
  }
```
