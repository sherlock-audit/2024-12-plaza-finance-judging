# Coupons may remain permanently locked in the ​Pool​ contract if ​Pool.distribute​ is not called in time

### Summary

In the `Pool.distribute` function, coupon tokens corresponding to a specific `previousPeriod` are transferred to the `Distributor` contract for user claims. However, if the `Pool.distribute` method is not called before the next period begins, the coupons for the skipped `previousPeriod` remain locked in the `Pool` contract indefinitely. These locked funds represent unclaimed user rewards, and users may encounter failures when calling `Distributor.claim` due to insufficient coupons.

```solidity
function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());

    // Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();

    if (Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT ||
        Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD) {

      emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
      return;
    }

    // Get Distributor
    address distributor = poolFactory.distributors(address(this));

    // Transfer coupon tokens to the distributor
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(distributor, couponAmountToDistribute);

    // Update distributor with the amount to distribute
    Distributor(distributor).allocate(couponAmountToDistribute);

    emit Distributed(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute, distributor);
}
```

As seen in the code, every call to `Pool.distribute` only processes the `previousPeriod` (i.e., `currentPeriod - 1`). If `distribute` is not called before the next period begins, the function will skip over the previous period. Consequently, the coupons for the skipped period will remain locked in the `Pool` contract and cannot be claimed by users.


### Root Cause

Failure to call `Pool.distribute` in a timely manner results in coupons being permanently locked in the `Pool` contract.


### Attack Path

1. A period ends, and an auction successfully raises coupons for that period.
2. No one calls `Pool.distribute` before the next period begins.
3. When `Pool.distribute` is eventually called, it processes only the latest `previousPeriod`, leaving earlier periods unprocessed.
4. The unprocessed coupons remain permanently locked in the `Pool` contract.

### Impact

User funds (coupons) remain permanently locked in the `Pool` contract, leading to lost user rewards.


### Mitigation

1. Automatically call `Pool.distribute` upon successful auction completion to transfer coupons immediately to the `Distributor`.
2. Allow the `Pool.distribute` function to specify any valid `period` instead of restricting it to `currentPeriod - 1`. This would allow for retroactive distribution of skipped periods.
