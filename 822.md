# Auction pull reserve tokens from next Auction schedule

### Summary

In contract `Pool.sol` once **distributionPeriod** ends an auction can be created within **auctionPeriod**. As the auction is created the calculation of **couponAmountToDistribute** takes current bond token minted in account. It calculates the max amount of coupon tokens that can be sold to buy current reserve tokens.

But when `Auction.endAuction()` is called it takes the current balance of reserve token into account. Which can be greater or less than amount when this auction was created. Which creates discrepancy in amount of reserve tokens that can be bought. User might bid but at the end of the auction there may not be enough reserve token in the pool and the Auction will fail. or users might end up buying more reserve tokens for this fixed amount of **couponAmountToDistribute** for this particular auction. Leaving less amount in the `Pool.sol` for the subsequent auction.

```solidity
   uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)
        .toBaseUnit(maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
```

```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();
    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
@=> } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

### Root Cause

**couponAmountToDistribute** amount is  calculated at the time of auction and it fixed. Which the reserve tokens to sell is dynamic and is decided at the end of the Auction. This will leave next auction with less reserve tokens to buy.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The newly staked reserve tokens gets used in an ongoing auction. Can leave Pool contract empty for next auction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the amount of reserve tokens to be sold at the time of auction creation. Send the max amount to be sold to the auction contract. Don't use newly staked tokens in an ongoing auction.
