# PoolSaleLimit can be breached in auctions as fee is not accounted for in calculations

## Description
The `endAuction()` function [reverts if the `poolSaleLimit` is breached](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341):
```js
    else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } 
```

The logic however forgets to account for any unclaimed fees and hence can overshoot the intended mark since it should not try to utilize the funds (reserveTokens) earmarked for fees. Imagine the following:
1. Suppose `poolSaleLimit = 95%` and [pool's fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273) = `10%`. Also, poolReserves or balance of reserveTokens in the pool = `900,000`.
2. If we consider that fee for 9 months is unclaimed when an auction is started, then the unclaimed fee would be `60,000`.
3. Let's consider `totalSellReserveAmount` at end of auction is `800,000`.
4. `endAuction()` should revert if `totalSellReserveAmount` >= `(900,000 - 60,000) * 95% = 840,000 * 95% = 798,000`, which it is.
5. However `endAuction()` checks if `totalSellReserveAmount` >= `900,000 * 95% = 855,000`, which it is not and incorrectly decides to "safely" allow the auction to end.

Further, if the admin goes ahead and tries to `claimFees()` after some time, he will find his calculations to be based off a reduced reserveToken balance since more than intended has already been auctioned off.

## Impact
- Greater than the safe limit of `poolSaleLimit` can be auctioned off, thus reducing the overall balance of reserveTokens the protocol wished to maintain.
- The protocol receives less than their rightfully owned share of fees.
- This could even cause CL to go below threshold thus offering the attacker to mint new tokens at a discounted rate.

## Mitigation 
Store the fees owed to the protocol at the end time of auction separately and exclude that from the reserveToken balance while comparing with `totalSellReserveAmount`.
