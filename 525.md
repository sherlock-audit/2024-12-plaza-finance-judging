# The `PreDeposit._deposit()` Logic Will Lock User `BPT` Token Funds in the BalancerRouter

### Summary

The conditional logic in the `PreDeposit` contract's `_deposit` function will cause asset locking for the user as the `BalancerRouter` contract transfers `BPT` tokens to `PreDeposit`, but only a capped amount is recorded and transferred. The remaining tokens are locked in the `BalancerRouter` contract, making them inaccessible to the user.


### Root Cause


In this function, the user will deposit assets and join the Balancer Pool. `BPT` tokens, based on the deposited assets, will be minted for `address(this)`. These `BPT` tokens will then be deposited into the Predposit contract.

```solidity
    function joinBalancerAndPredeposit(
        bytes32 balancerPoolId,
        address _predeposit,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        // Step 1: Join Balancer Pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = joinBalancerPool(balancerPoolId, assets, maxAmountsIn, userData);

        // Step 2: Approve balancerPoolToken for PreDeposit
        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(_predeposit, balancerPoolTokenReceived);

        // Step 3: Deposit to PreDeposit
        PreDeposit(_predeposit).deposit(balancerPoolTokenReceived, msg.sender);

        return balancerPoolTokenReceived;
    }
```

In the `PreDeposit` contract, the [_deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L118-L134) function there is logic implemented to ensure that if the reserve cap for that `PreDeposit` is reached, the transaction will revert, and no deposit will be executed.

But the problem arises when the `reserveCap` is not reached, but the sum of `amount` and `reserveAmount` exceeds the `reserveCap`. In such cases, the `reserveAmount` is adjusted as follows: 

```solidity
  function _deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) private checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
    if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached();

    //.. 
    if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
      amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
    }
    //..
```

And that adjusted `amount` will be recorded for the user and transferred from the `BalancerRouter` contract.

```solidity
    balances[recipient] += amount;
    reserveAmount += amount;

    IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

For example, if the `reserveCap` is `50e18` and the `reserveAmount` is `45e18`, the first check does not revert. However, if the user sends an `amount` of `20e18`, the second condition is met, and a new value is calculated for the user transfer:

```js 
    reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap
    45e18 + 20e18 >= 50e18
    65e18 >= 50e18
    amount = 50e18 - 45e18 --> 5e18
```

Thus, `amount = 5e18`, meaning only this amount must be transferred from the `BalancerRouter` contract to the `PreDeposit` contract to reach the `reserveCap`.

As a result, the user sends assets to the `BalancerRouter` contract, but only `5e18` is transferred to `address(this)` and recorded for the user with `balances[recipient] += amount;`. The remaining `15e18` worth of BPT tokens remain locked in the `BalancerRouter` contract.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path


1. **User Sends Assets**:  
   The user sends assets to the `BalancerRouter` contract to join the Balancer Pool.  

2. **Balancer Pool Mints BPT Tokens**:  
   The assets are converted into `BPT` tokens, which are held by the `BalancerRouter` contract.  

3. **Approval and Transfer to PreDeposit**:  
   The `BalancerRouter` contract approves the `PreDeposit` contract to transfer the entire `BPT` token amount.  

4. **PreDeposit Adjusts the Amount**:  
   - The `PreDeposit` contract checks if the `reserveCap` has been reached. If not, it proceeds.  
   - It calculates the `adjusted amount` of tokens to transfer to the `PreDeposit` contract:  
     - If the `reserveAmount + amount` exceeds the `reserveCap`, it adjusts the `amount` to `reserveCap - reserveAmount`.  

5. **Partial Transfer to PreDeposit**:  
   Only the `adjusted amount` of tokens is transferred from the `BalancerRouter` contract to the `PreDeposit` contract.  

6. **Excess Tokens Locked**:  
   The remaining tokens (`initial amount - adjusted amount`) are left in the `BalancerRouter` contract.  

7. **Assets Inaccessible to the User**:  
   Since the excess tokens are neither transferred to the `PreDeposit` contract nor returned to the user, they remain locked in the `BalancerRouter` contract indefinitely.  


### Impact

User funds are lost and locked in the `BalancerRouter` contract.

### Mitigation


Before calling `PreDeposit.deposit()`, the `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` function should calculate the remaining capacity in the `PreDeposit` contract and only transfer the allowable amount to prevent locking excess tokens in the `BalancerRouter` contract
