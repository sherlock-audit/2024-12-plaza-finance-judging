# The proctol claims incorrect amount of fees in pool and this is unfair to users

## Summary
The protocol claim fees from reserve tokens in pool and the amount of fee is calculated based on the time passed from `lastFeeClaimTime` to current time. However, this calculation is incorrect and is unfair to users.

## Root Cause

In the [Pool.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L700-L712) :: `claimFees()` function, the protocol claims fees,  which is a proportion of the reserve token.

```solidity
  function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
    require(msg.sender == feeBeneficiary || poolFactory.hasRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE(), msg.sender), NotBeneficiary());
@>  uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();
    
    if (feeAmount == 0) {
      revert NoFeesToClaim();
    }
    
    lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
    
    emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
  }
```

The amount of fee is calculated based on the time passed from `lastFeeClaimTime` to current time, not based on the time passed from deposit reserve time to current time.

As result, the protocol claims more fees than correct value and this is unfair to users, especially who deposited just before claim fees.

```solidity
  function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }
```

## Impact

The protocol claims more fees than correct value and this is unfair to users.

## Mitigation

Implement the fee calculation based on the time passed from deposit time to current time.
