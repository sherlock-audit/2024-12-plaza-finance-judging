# Incorrect Fee Calculation Logic Will Lead to Loss of Funds

### Summary

The use of ```(block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)``` in the ```getFeeAmount``` function will cause inconsistent fee calculations for users as the contract will not accurately reflect the total fees deducted during token creation or redemption. This is due to the fact that the ```simulateCreate``` and ```simulateRedeem``` functions subtract fees from ```poolReserve``` without storing the deducted fee amounts, leading to discrepancies when the owner later attempts to claim fees.

### Root Cause

The choice to use ```(block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)``` for fee calculation in [Pool.sol:719](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L719) is a mistake as it relies on a dynamic and ever-changing value ```(block.timestamp)```, which causes inconsistencies between the fees subtracted from ```poolReserves``` in [Pool.sol:273](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273) and [Pool.sol:433](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433) and the actual claimable fees calculated later. This design does not store the deducted fee amounts, leading to a mismatch when the owner attempts to claim fees.

### Impact

The protocol may claim more fees than intended due to the incorrect fee calculation, leading to a lack of funds available for users during token redemption. This discrepancy arises because the fees deducted during token creation and redemption are not accurately stored, resulting in insufficient reserves when users attempt to redeem their tokens.


### PoC


**Assumptions and Constants:**

- PRECISION = 1,000,000
- fee = 10,000 (1% fee, as fee / PRECISION = 0.01)
- SECONDS_PER_YEAR = 31,536,000 (365 days)
- Initial poolReserves = 1,000,000 ETH (for simplicity)
- lastFeeClaimTime = 1,000,000 (timestamp in seconds)
- Bob creates bondETH at timestamp = 1,100,000
- Protocol owner claims fees at timestamp = 1,200,000

**Step 1: Fee Calculation When Bob Creates BondETH**
  When Bob deposits to create ```bondETH```, the protocol calculates the fee based on the elapsed time since the last fee claim.
  
  Inputs:
  
  - Deposit Amount: Let's assume Bob deposits 100 ETH.
  - currentTimestamp = 1,100,000
  - lastFeeClaimTime = 1,000,000
  
  **Time Elapsed:**
  ```solidity
  timeElapsed = currentTimestamp - lastFeeClaimTime = 1,100,000 - 1,000,000 = 100,000 seconds
  ```
  **Fee Calculation:**
  The fee deducted from poolReserves is calculated as follows:
  ```solidity
  feeAmount = (poolReserves * fee * timeElapsed) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR)
  feeAmount = (1,000,000 * 10,000 * 100,000) / (1,000,000 * 31,536,000)
  feeAmount = 31.7098 ETH
  ```

**Step 2: Fee Calculation During Claim by Protocol Owner**
  Later on at timestamp = 1,200,000, the protocol owner tries to claim fees.

  **Inputs:**

  - currentTimestamp = 1,200,000
  - lastFeeClaimTime = 1,000,000

  **Time Elapsed:**
  ```soldiity
  timeElapsed = currentTimestamp - lastFeeClaimTime = 1,200,000 - 1,000,000 = 200,000 seconds
  ```

  **Fee Calculation:**
  The protocol calculates the claimable fees using the same formula:
  ```solidity
  claimableFees = (poolReserves * fee * timeElapsed) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR)
  claimableFees = (1,000,100 * 10,000 * 200,000) / (1,000,000 * 31,536,000)
  claimableFees = 63.4193 ETH
  ```

### Mitigation

1. Modify Return Parameters: Update the ```simulateCreate``` and ```simulateRedeem``` functions to return the calculated fee amounts along with other relevant values. This allows the calling functions (```_create``` and ```_redeem```) to capture the fee amounts.

2. Store Fees in Storage: In the ```_create``` and ```_redeem``` functions, store the returned fee amounts in state variables. This ensures that all deducted fees are accurately recorded and can be referenced later for claims.

3. Revise Fee Calculation Logic: Ensure that the ```getFeeAmount``` function retrieves the stored fee amounts rather than relying on dynamic calculations based on ```block.timestamp```. This will provide a consistent and accurate representation of claimable fees.
