# The Pool and Auction contracts handle the `sellCouponAmount` differently, resulting in a decimal mismatch.

## Summary
The Pool and Auction contracts use the same `couponToken`, but they handle the `sellCouponAmount` with different decimal precision.

## Vulnerability Details
The Pool calculates `couponAmountToDistribute` using normalized decimals (18 decimals for `couponToken`), while the Auction works with raw `sellCouponAmount` values without normalization.

This mismatch causes the Pool to receive fewer coupon tokens than anticipated during auctions, leading to an economic imbalance.

The `couponToken` is DAI, which has 18 decimals. In the Pool, the `couponAmountToDistribute` is calculated using normalized values, but in the Auction, users place bids using raw `sellCouponAmount` values without normalization.

1. The Pool computes `couponAmountToDistribute` using normalized values with 18 decimals.
2. Users submit bids with `sellCouponAmount` in raw, unnormalized values.

## Impact

The Pool receives fewer coupons than expected due to the Auction processing raw `sellCouponAmount` values without normalization. This leads to a mismatch between the DAI transferred and the coupons allocated. As a result, bondholders receive reduced rewards.

## Recommendations
1. make the bid submitted by bidder `sellCouponAmount` normalized.
