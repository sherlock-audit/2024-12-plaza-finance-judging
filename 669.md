# Method Auction.endAuction() in auction will always revert due to wrong globalPool() check in Pool contract

### Summary

The Auction is used to auction out reserve tokens in exchange for coupon tokens. The auctions historical data is stored in **bondToken** contract. Bond token uses the below mapping to keep track of current and past auctions.

```solidity
  struct IndexedGlobalAssetPool {
    uint256 currentPeriod;
    uint256 sharesPerToken;
    PoolAmount[] previousPoolAmounts;
  }
```

Whenever `Pool.sol` creates a new Auction using `startAuction()` it deploys an auction contract stores it in **previousPoolAmounts** and increment  **currentPeriod**. So, if the currentPeriod was 0, When a new auction is created the currentPeriod becomes 1 and auction data is stored in Pool.auctions[0].

Now, When the Auction is settling we call `endAuction()`. It internally calls `Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction()`.

The `Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction()` is where the bug is. It'll always revert. As mentioned above the auction data was stored in index 0. But `transferReserveToAuction()` is fetching index 1 and Pool.auctions[1] will be address(0). So this method will always fail. 

```solidity
  function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
@=> (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
@=> address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
@=> require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
  
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User's funds will be stuck in the `Auction.sol` contract as Auction will be stuck in **BIDDING** state. Because `endAuction()` is reverting. So users can't `claimBid()` or `claimRefund()`. A contract upgrade will be needed to rescue user funds.

### PoC

Add the following test in `plaza-evm/test/Auction.t.sol` file.

```solidity
  function testAuctionCurrentPeriodBug() public {
    address user1 = address(1001);
    vm.startPrank(governance);

    Pool(pool).setAuctionPeriod(10 days);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.warp(95 days);
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = Pool(pool).bondToken().globalPool();
    console.log("Current period before pool creation: ", currentPeriod);
    console.log("Check Auction address: ", Pool(pool).auctions(currentPeriod));
    Pool(pool).startAuction();
    console.log("--------Auction is started--------");

    (currentPeriod,) = Pool(pool).bondToken().globalPool();
    console.log("Current period after pool creation: ", currentPeriod);
    console.log("Check Auction address: ", Pool(pool).auctions(currentPeriod));
    console.log("Check Auction address of currentPeriod - 1: ", Pool(pool).auctions(currentPeriod - 1));
    address auctionAddress = Pool(pool).auctions(currentPeriod-1);
  }
```

## Output
As shown in the output below the `auctions[currentPeriod]` will be always address(0). The actual auction contract is stored in  `auctions[currentPeriod -1 ]`. So, `Auction.endAuction()` will never succeed.
```log
[PASS] testEndAuctionSuccess() (gas: 456846)
  Current period before pool creation:  0
  Check Auction address:  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  --------Auction is started--------
  Current period after pool creation:  1
  Check Auction address:  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  Check Auction address of currentPeriod - 1:  0x7576e4A0848577a952E1540AB79CF884C44b3a36
```

### Mitigation


```diff
  function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
--- address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
--- require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
+++ IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
+++ if(currentPeriod > 0) {
+++     address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod - 1];
+++     require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
+++     IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
+++ } else {
+++     revert("No auction found");
+++ }
  }
```
