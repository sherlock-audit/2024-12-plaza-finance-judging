# claiming during auction period can block another user from claiming shares earned in the past

### Summary

Auctions are used to generate coupon tokens for distribution to bond token holders for each period, after auctions conclude there should be enough funds for bond token holders to claim coupons according to their shares. Because shares are increased as soon as an auction starts, users can claim other users' unclaimed coupons from the distributor contract. A user whose funds are claimed will have to wait for current auction to end which is 10 days and auctions can fail to generate the needed coupon tokens in which case another auction would take place after 3 months.

### Root Cause

Users are allowed to claim funds during auction periods and coupon token shares increase as soon as an auction starts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user should have unclaimed coupon tokens

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Bob has 100 bond tokens and has unclaimed for period 0 and 1
2. Alice has 100 bond tokens and claimed for all periods, Alice mints another 100 bond tokens
3. An auction starts, shares for both users increase, Alice now claims Bob's unclaimed coupon tokens
4. Bob has to wait until the auction ends to claim his funds if auction is successful, if it's not then he has to wait for another auction period

### Impact

A user whose funds are claimed will have to wait until current auction ends which can be 10 days at the moment, on top of that auctions can fail to generate the needed coupon tokens in which case another auction would take place after 3 months.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not allow claiming coupon tokens while auctions are on going.
