# Auction Griefing via Blacklisted Token Transfers in removeExcessBids

### Summary

The `removeExcessBids` function in the Auction contract does not properly handle cases where token transfers fail due to blacklisting, leading to a potential auction griefing attack. If a user who gets blacklisted has active bids in the auction, the bid removal process can revert, preventing new bids from being placed and potentially blocking the entire auction mechanism.



### Root Cause

The issue stems from the [`removeExcessBids`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L250) function which attempts to refund tokens to bidders when their bids are removed or reduced. While the function uses safeTransfer, it doesn't handle cases where the transfer might fail due to the recipient being blacklisted by the token contract:


### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Attacker places a bid in the auction
Attacker gets blacklisted by the token contract (either intentionally or by external factors)
When a new bid comes in that would require removing or reducing excess bids
The removeExcessBids function attempts to refund tokens to the blacklisted address
The token transfer reverts, causing the entire transaction to fail
New bids cannot be placed as they require successful execution of removeExcessBids
The auction becomes effectively blocked

### Impact

Auction functionality can be completely blocked dince Legitimate users cannot place new bids


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Keep track of refunds in a separate mapping for later claiming
