# Blacklisted addresses can DOS the auction

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L250

In Auction.sol, we have `removeExcessBids()` function that removes certain bids according to their ratio. Here we have a transfer inside the loops that may revert if the recipient is blacklisted.

The problem becomes worse if an Attacker changes addresses, deliberately deposits low ratio bids at the start of the auction and proceeds to get blacklisted.

This will effectively ruin the whole process of Auctions and permanently DOS the protocol.

### Root Cause

The transfer shouldn't be done inside loops 

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker submits low bid at start of Auction
2. Attacker gets his address blacklisted
3. Attacker DOSes Auction
4. Attacker changes address and repeats 1-3 for every Auction.

### Impact

The protocol's Auction function effectively does not work by a motivated Attacker requiring little funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update a state mapping variable and allow the Users who had their bids rejected to claim from this state variable instead of directly transferring in the function itself.
