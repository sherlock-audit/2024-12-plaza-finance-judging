# Auction pool sale limit fails to consider the amount of fees owed

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341-L342

The Auction fails if the `totalSellReserveAmount ` exceeds `poolSaleLimit` percentage from the balance of pool, However this check is incorrect as it also includes the fees owed in the pool reserves as part of the pool reserves.

The fee amount owed is

It should rightly calculate the pool reserves as the remaining amount after fees reduction.


This makes `claimFees()` claim much lower value than what it was worth before the Auction's end, If the `claimFees()` is called before the Auction end then the Auction ends as it doesn't have enough value.

The scenario becomes worse and more frequent when the `poolSaleLimit` is close to 100% as when the `totalSellReserveAmount` is near this amount the fees would accumulate around ~ > 2% depending on the time difference between The Auction. 
Making the attack occur more frequently.

This would not happen if the pool reserves were calculated correctly accounting for the fees owed.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341-L342

Wrong pool reserve amount used as the fees is not accounted for.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Fees nearing 10%
2. Pool sale limit of 95%
3. `totalSellReserveAmount` above 90% of pool balance before the `claimFees` is called

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `ClaimFees()` called before Auction End
2. Auction fails

Or

1. Auction succeeds
2. ClaimFees() much lower than before

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correct pool reserve amount should be used while calculating the pool sale limit.
Optionally call claim fees before it to prevent fee loss after fix.
