# `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD` should be set to `125%` instead of `120%`.

### Summary

The price of `BondToken` depends on whether the `collateralLevel` is above or below `120%`.

- If `collateralLevel <= 120%`:

  `80%` of TVL is allocated for `BondToken`, so the price of `BondToken` is less than `120 * 80% = 96`.
- If `collateralLevel > 120%`:

  The price of `BondToken` is set to 100.

As you can see, when the `collateralLevel` moves from below to above `120%`, the price of `BondToken` changes from `<= 96` to `100`, indicating that the price curve is not continuous.

To ensure continuity, `125%` should be used instead of `120%`.

### Root Cause

The [getRedeemAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L511-L518) function calculates the `redeemRate` based on whether the `collateralLevel` is above or below `120%`.

- If `collateralLevel <= 120%`:
  ```solidity
    redeemRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply
  ```
  Here, `multiplier` is `80%`, and `assetSupply` is the total supply of `BondToken`. Since the `collateralLevel` is less than `120%`, the `redeemRate` will be less than `120 * 80% = 96`.
- If `collateralLevel > 120%`:
  ```solidity
    redeemRate = 100
  ```
As observed, when the `collateralLevel` moves from below to above `120%`, the `redeemRate` is not continuous, moves from `96` to `100` suddenly.

This means that when the `collateralLevel` is around `120%`, a minor increase in TVL can lead to a significant price increase of `BondToken`, resulting in substantial losses for `LeverageToken` holders, even as the TVL increases.

```solidity
      function getRedeemAmount(
        ...
        
        uint256 redeemRate;
511     if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
          redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
        } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
          redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
515     } else {
          redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
        }
        
        // Calculate and return the final redeem amount
        return ((depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) / ethPrice) / PRECISION;
      }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

1. Current State of the Pool:
    - `TVL`: 1190
    - `bondSupply`: 10
    - `collaterlLevel`: 119%
    - TVL for `BondToken`: 1190 * 0.8 = 952
    - TVL for `LeverageToken`: 1190 * 0.2 = 238
2. Price of Underlying Rises:
    - `TVL`: 1210 (due to price increase)
    - `bondSupply`: 10
    - `collaterlLevel`: 121%
    - TVL for `BondToken`: 100 * 10 = 1000
    - TVL for `LeverageToken`: 1210 - 100 = 210

As you can see, `LeverageToken` holders incur a loss of `238 - 210 = 28`, even though the underlying price has increased.

### Impact

Even though the price of the underlying increases, `LeverageToken` holders incur a loss.

### PoC

### Mitigation

For `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, use `125%` instead of `120%`.
