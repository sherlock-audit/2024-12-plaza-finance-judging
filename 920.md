# Auction fails at `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` even if total reserve tokens sold does not exceed poolSaleLimit

## Summary

When auction ends, the auction can fail at `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` even if `totalSellReserveAmount` does not exceed `poolSaleLimit` due to equality check present.

## Vulnerability Details

In `Auction.endAuction`, when the `totalSellReserveAmount` is equal to the `poolSaleLimit`, the auction will end at a failed state even though the `totalSellReserveAmount` does not exceed the `poolSaleLimit`

```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) { // @audit auction fails if totalReserveAmount = Pool sale limit
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

## POC

Consider the following scenario

1. An Auction is started and ends with totalSellReserveAmount = 90% (`poolSaleLimit`) of sellReserveToken in the Pool.
2. Calling `Auction.endAuction` will cause state of auction to be at `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;`
3. No `couponTokens` will be transferred from the `Auction` to the `Pool` and thus no coupon tokens are transferred from the `Pool` to the `Distributor`
4. This will prevent bondETH holders to be able to receive their share of the coupon tokens for the periods' auction even though the auction should have succeeded since the `totalSellReserveAmount` did not exceed the pool's sale limit.

## Impact

Auction fails and bondETH holders might lose out on their share of couponTokens.

## Mitigation

Remove the equality check in `Auction.endAuction`.
