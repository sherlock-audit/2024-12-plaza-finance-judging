# Reuse of Token Approvals in `joinBalancerPool` Leads to Potential Asset Drain


#### **Bug Description**
In the `joinBalancerPool` function, the contract [increases token allowances to the Balancer Vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L74) without first resetting unused allowances. Specifically, this code snippet:  
```solidity
IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]);
```  
creates a situation where previously approved, unused token amounts persist across transactions. If an attacker identifies leftover allowances from a prior transaction (e.g. due to partial usage or reverts), they can exploit these approvals by directly interacting with the Balancer Vault to transfer tokens from the contract without permission. This "reuse of approval" bug arises because `safeIncreaseAllowance` appends new approvals to the existing allowance rather than clearing them, exposing user funds to malicious exploits.

#### **Impact**
A complete drain of the contract's token balances due to leftover approvals being exploited by attackers to transfer tokens directly from the contract to their address.

#### **Mitigation**
Always reset token allowances to zero before increasing them.
