# "Price Instability of BondToken and LevelToken Due to Collateral Level Fluctuations and Creation Price Adjustment"

### Summary

When the Collateral Level is 1.2, the price of the BondToken is 100 USD. However, once the Collateral Level drops below 1.2, the Creation Price adjusts to 80% of the vault's collateral value per bondETH. At this point, the price of bondETH will drop directly to 96.

tvl / bondSupply * 100 = 1.2

bondETHCreatePrice = tvl * 0.8 / bondSupply = 1.2 * 0.8 * 100 = 96

Once the Collateral Level falls below 1.2, the price of bondETH will decrease from 100 to 96, a drop of about 4%. Similarly, the price of leveltoken will instantly increase by around 4%. This results in a sharp price change.

If the ETH price remains stable, as more people create leveltokens, the price of the BondToken will stabilize at 96, unless the ETH price increases. However, the target BOND_TARGET_PRICE is 100, causing a mismatch between the expected price stability and the actual price.
