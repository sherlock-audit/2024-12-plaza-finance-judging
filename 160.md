```

### Mitigation

```diff
        // Check whether reserve contains enough funds
-        if (reserveAmount < minAmount) {
+       if (getPoolInfo().reserve < reserveAmount ) {
              revert MinAmount();

+   // Check slippage
        if (reserveAmount < minAmount) {
              revert MinAmount();
            }
