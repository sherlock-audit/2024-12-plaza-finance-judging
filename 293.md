# High-Severity Reentrancy in `claimBid()` and `claimRefund()

## Summary / Impact
The `Auction.sol` contract is vulnerable to a **reentrancy attack** in its `claimBid()` and `claimRefund()` functions. Specifically, the code transfers tokens to the caller **before** updating the state (`bidInfo.claimed = true`). If the caller is a malicious contract, it can reenter the function (e.g., via fallback/callback) and claim multiple times in a single transaction.  
- **Impact**: Potentially unlimited double-claims, resulting in complete loss of the auction’s escrowed funds.

## Vulnerable Code

Both lines highlighted in comments put the contract at risk of reentrancy.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
1. **Setup**: An attacker creates a malicious contract that calls `claimBid()` or `claimRefund()`.  
2. **Reentrant Call**: Inside the attacker’s fallback function (triggered by `IERC20.transfer()` or `safeTransfer()`), it calls `claimBid()` or `claimRefund()` again **before** `bidInfo.claimed` is updated.  
3. **Repeat**: The state is not yet changed, so the attacker can drain the entire deposit by repeatedly claiming.  

A simplified pseudo-code version of the attacker’s fallback:
```solidity
fallback() external {
    // Re-call claimBid() or claimRefund() if it hasn’t been marked claimed
    if (!alreadyReentered) {
        alreadyReentered = true;
        auction.claimBid(1);
    }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Reproduction
1. Attacker places a bid (or any function that sets up a claim).  
2. Time passes so the auction ends and `claimBid()`/`claimRefund()` is unlocked.  
3. Attacker calls `claimBid()` from the malicious contract.  
4. `transfer()` triggers fallback → fallback re-calls `claimBid()` again.  
5. Because the `bidInfo.claimed` flag is set **after** the transfer, the attacker can claim multiple times.
