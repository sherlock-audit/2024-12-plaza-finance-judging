# In the contract pool.sol#L589, the distribute function can be called arbitrarily.

### Summary

If the contract `pool` contains a `couponToken`, the `distribute` function can be called arbitrarily. When distributing tokens from a previous auction period, it can be called multiple times.

**First Round Auction:**

The first round of the auction ends.

**Second Round Auction:**

After the second round auction begins, a user calls the `distribute` function to distribute the tokens successfully auctioned off in the first round (`couponAmountToDistribute`). This means that by the end of the second round auction, the funds from the first round have already been distributed.

After the second round auction ends, the user calls the `distribute` function again. At this point, the system tries to distribute the tokens from the first round auction (`couponAmountToDistribute`) again, resulting in the funds from the first round being distributed twice.

**Third Round Auction:**

After the third round auction begins, the user calls the `distribute` function to distribute the tokens from the second round auction (`couponAmountToDistribute`).



However, since the tokens from the first round auction were already distributed twice during the second round, it causes insufficient funds in the pool to properly distribute the tokens from the second round, leading to a distribution failure.

The core issue of this problem lies in the `distribute` function's call logic. If the distribution status of the tokens from each round is not clearly marked after the auction ends, it could lead to the tokens being distributed multiple times. This repeated distribution disrupts the normal operation of subsequent auctions and ultimately causes insufficient funds in the pool, preventing proper distribution.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact


The tokens cannot be distributed properly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `distribute` function should be restricted to ensure that tokens from each round can only be distributed once.
