# Due to reserve amount logic in createPool(), pool cannot be deployed

### Summary

As we know that , we cannot create pool if there will no reserve tokens . And reserve are gained during  the predeposit duration, when user deposit that. Also there is cap of that in predeposit period. And due to this there can be scenario where no pool will be created, when duration completed there will be 0 reserve tokens deposited. So attacker gain exploit this. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L150

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker has reserve token upto the cap that has been set for predeposit duration

### Attack Path

Let consider a scenario.

Attacker will deposit reserve token same as the cap which is set for predeposit period. Now no one will able to deposit as cap has been reached.
Now attacker will withdraw all his reserves just before the contest ends. And he will leave so much less time that no one will able to deposit .
Due to this , scenario will be created that, 0 reserve token after preDeposit period. Attacker can do this consistently for every pool, and as a result pool will not be able to deployed. So whenever pool has to be deployed with this reserve of predeposit time , each time situation can arise that no pool can be deployed with that

### Impact

As i stated above, no pool can be deployed if attacker willl do this consistently

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Simple solution can be made that, some time before ( predecided like 10%  of total duration) no withdraw can take place and only deposit is allowed.
so even if attacker removes, other will have chance to deposit
