# Previous period can be distributed multiple times.

### Summary

Due to lack of check whether a period has already been distributed, `distribute` on Pool contract can be called multiple times transferring funds each time.

### Root Cause

`Pool.distrubute` can be called by anyone as long as the current period is not 0. This leads to a vulnerability where the function can be called multiple times transferring `couponAmountToDistribute `amounts of `couponToken`  each time. This can be done either maliciously or non-maliciously where parties are not aware whether it was called before. The issue leads to `Pool `contract being depleted of the `couponToken`. Also, it can be used to have enough funds on `Distributor `contract in case the `claim `is reverting due to not having enough funds.
