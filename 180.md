# Stuck tokens in `BalancerRouter`

### Summary

`BalancerRouter` will be transferred both `maxAmountsIn` that will be required to join the pool. However the `joinPool` operation will always use less than the `maxAmountIn` specified. As a result a portion of the tokens will be stuck forever in the contract.

### Root Cause

The user will transfer both `maxAmountsIn` to the contract:
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]); 
        }
```
However as per balancer docs the maxAmountsIn will be more than what actually will be spent by the `joinPool`:
https://docs-v2.balancer.fi/reference/joins-and-exits/pool-joins.html#maxamountsin
As a result there will be stuck tokens in the contract, since users will not be refunded the excess amount.

### External Pre-conditions
