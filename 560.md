# Fees handling based on current amount of token in the pool will result in fluctuation of the actual claimed fees

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L700

### Summary

The `Pool` contract implements a claiming fee feature to remunerate the protocol. The fees are calculated using **the current balance of the `reserveToken` in the pool**, which is a bad practice as this amount will fluctuate when users deposit or withdraw tokens in the pool, and when auctions are paid.

This may lead to some unintended behaviors, like admin claiming less fees than they expect if a user withdraw their reserveToken just before or an auction succeeds.

Another case scenario would be having a valid auction where bidders are near the limit of the reserveToken in cumulative rewards. If the fees are claimed, the balance of the pool will change and may cause the auction to not succeed anymore.

### Root Cause

Bad handling of fee amount result in fluctuation of fees claimed whenever tokenReserve are transfered

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Calling `Pool::claimFees` function after a token transfer

### Impact

Fees claimed amount is not as high or higher than expected. Beneficiary claiming the fees may end up with a different amount than expected. 

### PoC

> You need to set the visibility of `Pool::getFeeAmount` from `internal` to `public` to see its value

Copy this function in `Pool.t.sol` :

```solidity
// forge test --mt test_fees_fluctuation -vvv
function test_fees_fluctuation() public {
    vm.startPrank(governance);
    Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);

    // Mint reserve tokens
    rToken.mint(governance, 10000001000);
    rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 10000000000);

    // Create pool
    Pool _pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(params, 10000000000, 10000, 10000, "", "", "", "", false));
    _pool.setAuctionPeriod(10 days);
    _pool.setFee(10_000);

    // Warps ahead so `block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime` is not 0
    vm.warp(1 days);

    // You need to set the visibility of `Pool::getFeeAmount` from `internal` to `public` to see its value
    console.log("Values of fees before a user deposit 1e18 reserveToken in the pool", _pool.getFeeAmount());

    // Adds reserveToken in the pool
    rToken.mint(address(governance), 1e18);
    rToken.approve(address(_pool), 1e18);
    _pool.create(Pool.TokenType.BOND, 1e18, 0);

    console.log("Values of fees at the same time, but after the deposit", _pool.getFeeAmount());

    // If we redeem the tokens, we go back to the previous value of fees
}
```

This test gives the following output :

```console
$ forge test --mt test_fees_fluctuation -vvv

### Mitigation

Change the mechanism to collect the fees so they are added in a variable to prevent the price from fluctuating. This fee collection can be calculated before every reserveToken transaction and calculate the fees based on the actual balance of the pool, accounting for the time elapsed since last calculation.

Using a variable accounting for the fees available to withdraw ensure integrity of the pool.
