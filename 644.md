# Blacklisted lowest bidder in Auction.bid() prevents proper bid removal, leading to potential auction failure or suboptimal revenue

### Summary

In `Auction.bid()`, the coupon token is USDC (a centralized entity), and the auction may require removing the lowest bidder if a new bid exceeds the `maxBids` limit. However, if the lowest bidder has since been blacklisted (e.g., due to external regulatory compliance), their bid cannot be removed or refunded. This creates two critical issues:

1. If `currentCouponAmount` falls below `totalBuyCouponAmount`, the auction will fail with a `FAILED_UNDERSOLD` state.
2. If `currentCouponAmount` equals `totalBuyCouponAmount`, the auction will succeed but will exclude higher implied price bids, sacrificing more reserve tokens than intended.

### Root Cause

1. Blacklist Restrictions:

- If a bidder is blacklisted, their USDC cannot be refunded due to compliance or external constraints. This prevents their bid from being removed from the sorted bid list.
2. Rigid Bid Logic:

- The auction mechanism depends on dynamically removing the lowest bid to accommodate better bids and maintain `maxBids`. A blacklisted bidder disrupts this process, locking in their bid and preventing optimal bid list adjustments.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A bidder's address is blacklisted, preventing token transfers to them.
2. The auction has reached its `maxBids` limit and requires removing the lowest bid.

### External Pre-conditions

Regulatory or external constraints enforce blacklisting, preventing transfers of USDC to the blacklisted address.

### Attack Path

1. Auction Initialization:

- The auction is initialized with [`maxBids`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L108) (typically 1000) set, and bids begin to be placed.
2. Blacklisted Bidder Places a Bid:

- A bidder who is later blacklisted after placing a bid, and their bid is included in the auction.
3. Auction Hits the `maxBids` Limit:

- The auction reaches its maximum bid limit (`maxBids`), requiring the removal of the lowest bid to accommodate a new bid with a better implied price. And, it happens that the now USDC blacklisted bidder is associated with `lowestBidIndex`. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L153-L158

```solidity
    if (bidCount > maxBids) {
      if (lowestBidIndex == newBidIndex) {
        revert BidAmountTooLow();
      }
      _removeBid(lowestBidIndex);
    }
```

4. Removal of Blacklisted Bidder Fails:

- The protocol attempts to [refund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L325) the lowest bidder's USDC during the `_removeBid()` function. Since the bidder is blacklisted, the token transfer fails, preventing the removal of their bid. No one else can call bid().
5. Auction Impact:

- Scenario A: If `currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount`, the auction fails with a [`FAILED_UNDERSOLD`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L339-L340) state.
- Scenario B: If `currentCouponAmount == totalBuyCouponAmount`, the auction succeeds, but bids with higher implied prices are excluded, sacrificing more reserve tokens.


### Impact

1. Auction Failure:

- If `currentCouponAmount` falls below `totalBuyCouponAmount` and the lowest bid cannot be removed, the auction will fail with the `FAILED_UNDERSOLD` state. Bond token holders will receive no coupon distributions for the period.
2. Suboptimal Revenue:

- If `currentCouponAmount` equals `totalBuyCouponAmount`, the auction will succeed but will exclude better bids with higher implied prices. This inadvertently drains the protocol's reserve tokens.
3. Inefficient Auctions:

The presence of a blacklisted bidder undermines the auction's ability to prioritize bids with better implied prices, resulting in an overall less efficient auction process.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To handle the refund process gracefully without failing the entire auction, we can use Solidity's `try/catch` mechanism when attempting to transfer USDC to the bidder. This avoids halting the auction due to a single blacklisted address.
