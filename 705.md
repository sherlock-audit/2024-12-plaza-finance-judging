# Modifier NotInAuction() always returns true

### Summary

In contract `Pool.sol` modifier `NotInAuction()` is used to update critical variables in `setDistributionPeriod()`, `setAuctionPeriod()` and `setSharesPerToken()` method. but the modifier always returns true.

```solidity
  modifier NotInAuction() {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0), AuctionIsOngoing());
    _;
  }
```

When an auction is created currentPeriod is incremented. So the new currentPeriod will always have auctions[currentPeriod] as address(0) so `auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0)` will be always true.

### Impact

Critical variables like **distributionPeriod**, **auctionPeriod** & **sharesPerToken** can be set irrespective of state of current auction. If any of these variables are updated it'll affect the subsequent auctions. Current depositors of `Pool.sol` will be unaware of these changes happening mid distributionPeriod. 

If **distributionPeriod** is decreased it might lead to start of new auction before the ending of previous one. Which will cause `transferReserveToAuction()` to revert as it only looks at most recent auction. 

### PoC

### Mitigation

Check the purpose of `NotInAuction` modifier. If we need to check if the current auction is completed then `Auction(auctions[currentPeriod]).state` can be used. If it is `State.BIDDING` then auction is ongoing.
