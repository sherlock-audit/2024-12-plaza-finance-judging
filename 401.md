# Discrepencies between docs and codebase may cause users to skip rewards and loss of trust in the protocol

### Summary

https://docs.plaza.finance/protocol-mechanics/coupon-distributions

The documentation states that "_Whoever holds the bond token at the time of distribution is owed the debt coupon until they claim it_". This assumes that [`pool::distribute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589) takes a snapshot of the users balance.

However, the implementation records debt coupon ownership per periods, which change when a new auction begins (call to [`pool::startAuction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L567)).

If a user wants to hold their bond tokens until the next reward, and sell them when the distribution occurs but no new auction started, they will not be entitled to receiving the reward they are expecting, causing loss of trust in the protocol.

### Root Cause

Documentation states that the distribution takes snapshot of users `bondToken`, but the code implements it in `startAuction`

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Let's say Alice wants to hold her `bondToken` until the next snapshot, to earn one more round of coupons. When `pool::distribution` is called, she either redeems to the protocol or sends her token to someone else.

The next `Pool::startAuction` creates a new snapshot of users `bondToken` balance.

When the next distribution occurs, Alice is deceived in finding that she has no shares to claim in the distribution.

### Impact

Medium, the code is not working as it should. Note that when a user has the same expectations that Alice does, they can make the mistake of redeeming/sending their token in an `distributionPeriod - auctionPeriod` amount of time.

This is because the function `Pool::distribute` (expected checkpoint in the documentation) will be callable after the auction succeeds, so `auctionPeriod` amount of time after `Pool::startAuction` is called, and `Pool::startAuction` (actual checkpoint in the code) will be callable every `distributePeriod` amount of time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Edit the documentation to correctly state how the code is working
