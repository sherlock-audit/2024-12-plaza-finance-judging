# A malicious attacker can prevent the creation of pool in the  `PreDeposit` contract.

## Summary
In the `PreDeposit` contract, a attacker can block the creation of a pool contract by manipulating the `reserveAmount` within the `PreDeposit` contract.

## Vulnerability Details
Since a pool cannot be created wih 0  `reserveAmount` because of the check in the `createPool` function.

A single attacker can deposit the full amount equal to the` reserveCap` before any other user, effectively preventing others from making deposits. 

Just before the deposit time ends, the attacker withdraws the entire amount from the contract, leaving the `reserveAmount` at zero. As a result, the contract suffers a Denial of Service (DoS), and the pool cannot be created.
The time has passed the deposit period so other user cannot deposit any amount now.

```solidity
function createPool() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (reserveAmount == 0) revert NoReserveAmount();
    if (bondAmount == 0 || leverageAmount == 0) revert InvalidBondOrLeverageAmount();
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
    IERC20(params.reserveToken).approve(address(factory), reserveAmount);
    pool = factory.createPool(params, reserveAmount, bondAmount, leverageAmount, bondName, bondSymbol, leverageName, leverageSymbol, true);

    emit PoolCreated(pool);
    poolCreated = true;
  }
```
Attacker deposit full amount and withdraw just before the deposit time ends.
## Impact

It prevents the creation of the pool contract.

## Recommendations
Following can be done to prevent this : -

1. Do not allow a single user to deposit the full amount of `reservecap`.
2. make some change in the withdrawl function to prevent this.
