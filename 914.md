# Malicious Actors will Cause Financial Loss to Token Holders

### Summary

The inherent design of integer division in the `Decimals.sol` library functions, specifically [`toBaseUnit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/lib/Decimals.sol#L13) and [`normalizeAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/lib/Decimals.sol#L34), will cause a systematic loss of small token amounts for users due to precision loss. This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors through executing multiple transactions with minuscule token amounts, leading to potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or significant financial discrepancies over time.


### Root Cause

In `Decimals.sol`, the functions `toBaseUnit(uint256 amount, uint8 decimals)` and `normalizeAmount(uint256 amount, uint8 fromDecimals, uint8 toDecimals)` employ integer division, which truncates any amount below the base unit to zero.

For example `toBaseUnit` will return 0 for any input amount less than 10^decimals:
     * - With 18 decimals (like ETH), any amount < 1 ETH (< 10^18 wei) returns 0
     * - 0.1 ETH (100000000000000000 wei) converts to 0
     * - 0.9999... ETH converts to 0

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Lack of Minimum Transaction Size**: There should be no enforcement of a minimum transaction size for token transfers or conversions, allowing for transactions with amounts too small to be accurately represented after conversion.

2. **No Safe Conversion Mechanism**: The absence of mechanisms like fixed-point arithmetic or precision-aware conversion functions exacerbates the vulnerability.

### External Pre-conditions

1. **No External Dependency**: This vulnerability is intrinsic to the contract's logic and does not rely on external conditions or price oracles. However, high transaction throughput or the presence of bots designed to exploit such weaknesses could amplify the issue.

### Attack Path

1.**Initiate Small Transfers**: An attacker initiates multiple transactions, each with token amounts below the precision threshold of the target token (e.g., less than 10^6 for USDC, or 10^18 for ETH).

2.**Exploit Precision Loss**: These transactions are processed through functions like toBaseUnit or normalizeAmount, where due to integer division, all small amounts are rounded down to zero, effectively nullifying the transfer but still consuming gas or potentially disrupting normal contract operations.

3.**DoS or Financial Manipulation**: By repeating this process, the attacker can either aim for a DoS by overwhelming the contract with processing or subtly manipulate financial records by making transactions appear as if no tokens were moved.

### Impact

1.**Financial Loss**: Users might unknowingly lose small amounts of tokens over time, which could accumulate into significant losses, particularly in systems dealing with high volumes of transactions.

2.**System Inefficiencies**: The contract might become inefficient or fail to account for small transactions correctly, leading to operational issues or incorrect financial tracking.

3.**Potential for Exploitation**: Although attackers might not directly gain from these transactions, they can cause system disruption or use this as part of a broader strategy in more complex attacks.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1.**Implement Safe Conversion**: Create functions that either revert when precision loss would occur or use fixed-point arithmetic to handle fractional amounts accurately.
