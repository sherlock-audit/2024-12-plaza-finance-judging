# Incorrect fees deduction logic calculation while calling redeem will cause incosistency in determing amount of reserve tokens to send

### Summary

Due to incorrect fee calculation logic at [Pool.sol:433](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433) which deducts fees for total amount of reserve token in Pool at time of redeem transaction rather then deducting fees according to separate amount during separate duration it will lead to incosistency in calculation of reserve tokens to send.

### Root Cause

The choice to calculate Pool fees at [Pool.sol:433](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433) is a mistake as it calculates fees for total reserve amount in Pool since last claim time rather then considering fees according to separate time since when the redeem of that funds happend through redeem call causing incosistency in calculation of amount of reserve tokens to send.

Example:- 
- Pool created with 1000 ETH of reserve tokens and 2% fees after 10 days User A called deposit of 10 ETH tokens through create function. 
- After 10 more days User B deposited 15 ETH tokens through create function.
- After 10 more days User C deposits 20 ETH tokens through create function.
- After 10 more days of that if User B tries to redeem some bond/leverage tokens through redeem function in calculation of deducting fees at [Pool.sol:433](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433) should deduct fees for (1000ETH <> 40 days), (10ETH <> 30 days), (15ETH <> 20 days), (20ETH <> 10 days) but according to current logic it deducts for (1045ETH <> 40 days) which is wrong.

### Attack Path

- Pool created with 1000 ETH of reserve tokens and 2% fees after 10 days User A called deposit of 10 ETH tokens through create function. 
- After 10 more days User B deposited 15 ETH tokens through create function.
- After 10 more days User C deposits 20 ETH tokens through create function.
- After 10 more days of that if User B tries to redeem some bond/leverage tokens through redeem function in calculation of deducting fees at [Pool.sol:433](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433) should deduct fees for (1000ETH <> 40 days), (10ETH <> 30 days), (15ETH <> 20 days), (20ETH <> 10 days) but according to current logic it deducts for (1045ETH <> 40 days) which is wrong.

### Impact

Due to incosistency in fees calculation logic at [Pool.sol:433](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433) during redeem function it will deduct more fees then it should leading to incosistency in calculation logic for determining amount of reserve tokens to send leading to loss in funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Need to change the fees calculation method instead of calculating it with `IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR` which is wrong need to track through a variable at time of redeem and track amount based on timestamp when actions happen.
