# Missing Price Floor in BondETH Coupon Auctions Enables Below-Market ETH Sales

## Summary
A critical vulnerability in Plaza's auction mechanism allows manipulation of ETH sale prices due to missing minimum price validation. This can force the protocol to sell ETH significantly below market value, threatening its ability to meet bondETH coupon obligations and potentially leading to systemic failure.

## Vulnerability Details

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336

```solidity
function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
        state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
        state = State.SUCCEEDED;
        Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
}
```

The issue is that while bids are ordered by price, there is no minimum price requirement. The auction succeeds as long as the total USDC amount (`totalBuyCouponAmount`) is met, regardless of how little ETH is offered in return.

## Impact
The auction mechanism's lack of price validation enables malicious actors to drain protocol value through coordinated underbidding. During quarterly auctions, participants can bid significantly below market rates while still meeting the total USDC requirement, forcing the protocol to accept these unfavorable sales to maintain coupon payments. This creates a destructive cycle - each underpriced ETH sale reduces available collateral, requiring larger sales in subsequent quarters to maintain coupon obligations. The quarterly schedule amplifies this damage as a single compromised auction impacts three months of protocol operations, with the effects compounding over time as increasingly larger portions of collateral must be sold to compensate for previous losses.

## Proof of Concept
Attack scenario:
1. Attacker waits for quarterly auction
2. Submits bids offering 50% below market price
3. Places enough bids to meet `totalBuyCouponAmount`
4. Auction succeeds due to lack of price checks
5. Protocol loses significant value on ETH sale
6. Must sell more ETH next quarter to compensate

## Recommended Mitigation
Add minimum price validation to the bid function:

```solidity
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external {
    // Get current ETH price from oracle
    uint256 minPrice = getOraclePrice(sellReserveToken) * SAFETY_MARGIN;  // e.g. 95%
    
    // Calculate effective bid price
    uint256 bidPrice = (buyReserveAmount * PRECISION) / sellCouponAmount;
    
    // Require minimum price
    require(bidPrice >= minPrice, "Bid price too low");
    
    // Continue with existing bid logic
    ...
}
```

The fix is critical as this vulnerability directly threatens the protocol's ability to maintain its core bondETH fixed coupon payments.
