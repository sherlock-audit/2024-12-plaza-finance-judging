# Blacklisted `USDC` user could DoS the `Auction` contract

### Summary

The `Plaza` protocol creates `Auctions` after each `Pool`'s distribution period, as a means to collect `couponTokens` which are the main incentive backing `bondETH` tokens. Users bid `couponTokens` to win some of the pool's `reserveToken`. `Auctions` have a `maxBids` value, however, when it is reached, the lowest bid is removed, and the new one is added.

```solidity
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns(uint256) {
...SNIP...
    if (bidCount > maxBids) {
      if (lowestBidIndex == newBidIndex) {
        revert BidAmountTooLow();
      }
      _removeBid(lowestBidIndex);
    }
...SNIP....
  }
```

When the lowest bid is removed, the bidder's `sellCouponAmount` is refunded. However, this introduces a risk of a DoS in the event of this user being blacklisted, which will end up in a failed auction, leading to missed distribution of `couponToken` to `bondETH` holders.

### Root Cause

This is caused because when removing bids the protocol sends funds directly to the user, and when a user is blacklisted he/she cannot receive any `USDC` and will revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction should be started
2. User to be blacklisted joins the auction.

### External Pre-conditions

1. User gets blacklisted as a `USDC` user.

### Attack Path

1. User to be blacklisted makes a bid (the bid could either be a normal one, or something like `(minAmountUSDC, maxAmountReserveToken) - creating the lowest offer possible so he gets put at the end of the linked list.`)
2. User gets blacklisted.
3. In the first case, if the max bids are reached, the blacklisted user's bid can't be removed and new users can't get in, so the required `couponTokens` won't be met, and the auction will end in `State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD`.
4. The other case, if the required `couponTokens` are met, then the `Auction` will try to end with `maxAmountReserveToken`, which will result in `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`..
5. Both cases will lead to a failed distribution and `bondETH` holders who can't claim  `couponTokens`.

### Impact

The auction won't finish in a successful state, leading to a missed distribution of `couponTokens`, which prevents `bondETH` holders from benefiting.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Save refunded bid amounts in a data structure, and allow users to manually withdraw them.
