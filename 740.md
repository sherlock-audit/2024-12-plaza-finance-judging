# ​​sellReserveToken​ may return ​false​ instead of reverting, leading to permanent loss of funds during ​claimBid​

### Summary

Within the `Auction.claimBid` function, the `transfer` method of `sellReserveToken` is called to transfer tokens to the user. However, if `sellReserveToken` is a non-standard ERC20 token that returns `false` on failure instead of reverting, the user will not receive their tokens. At the same time, the `bidInfo.claimed` flag will be set to `true`, permanently locking the user's tokens in the contract.

```solidity
function claimBid(uint256 bidIndex) auctionExpired auctionSucceeded whenNotPaused external {
    Bid storage bidInfo = bids[bidIndex];
    if (bidInfo.bidder != msg.sender) revert NothingToClaim();
    if (bidInfo.claimed) revert AlreadyClaimed();

    bidInfo.claimed = true;
    IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);  // @audit sellReserveToken could be a non-standard ERC20

    emit BidClaimed(bidIndex, bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
}
```

If `sellReserveToken.transfer` fails and returns `false`, the tokens remain in the contract and the user loses the ability to claim them due to the `bidInfo.claimed` flag being set.


### Root Cause

The `transfer` method may return `false` instead of reverting when it fails.


### Attack Path

1. A user attempts to call `claimBid` to claim their `sellReserveToken` after an auction ends.
2. The `transfer` call for `sellReserveToken` fails and silently returns `false`.
3. The `bidInfo.claimed` flag is updated to `true`, preventing any further attempts to claim the funds.
4. The user's funds remain locked in the contract indefinitely.

### Impact

Loss of funds due to permanently locked tokens in the contract.


### Mitigation

Replace `transfer` with `safeTransfer` from `SafeERC20` to ensure proper handling of ERC20 token transfer failures. This will ensure that any failure in token transfer will result in a revert, preventing the `bidInfo.claimed` flag from being incorrectly updated.
