# coupon shares are accounted for failed auctions leads to inconsistent coupon distributions

### Summary

At the end of every period, some reserves will be auctioned off and the bond token holders will be paid by the sales. Even if auctions fail and coupon tokens are not generated, coupon shares are still attributed to bond token holders for that period. Because coupon shares to distribute are calculated based on the supply of bond tokens, distributions will be inconsistent and some of the users might not get paid.

### Root Cause

Users are attributed coupon token shares even if the auction for that period fails. You can see that bond period is increased at the start of the auction and this increases the shares of bond holders:

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An auction needs to fail

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Bob has 100 bond tokens
2. Auction for period 0 fails and Bob is attributed 250 coupons anyways
3. Alice joins with 100 bond tokens, another auction takes place this time successfully, 250 coupons are attributed to Bob and Alice each
4. Distributor has 500 coupon tokens for distribution, if Bob claims first he will get all 500, if Alice claims first Bob will not be able to claim as there will not be enough coupon tokens in the contract
At this point the unpaid participant has to wait 3 months for another auction to take place and still might not get paid as the scenario can happen again.

### Impact

Distributions are inconsistent and some of the users might not get paid if a failed auction occurs.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Increasing periods at the end of auctions would bring Zellic 3.9 back so the mitigation is not trivial.
