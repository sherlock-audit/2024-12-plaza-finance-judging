# Incorrect handling of decimals of `marketRate` during token redemption

### Summary

When tokens are being redeemed, especially for bond tokens, the market price of the token is fetched from the oracle and passed to `getRedeemAmount` function so that it can replace redeem rate with lower one.

However, the `marketRate` fetched from the oracle has `oracleDecimals` which will be 8 or 18 in general, while in `getRedeemAmount`, it expects the `marketRate` to be in `PRECISION` decimals, which is 6.

### Root Cause

The issue arises from [simulateRedeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L449) function, where it converts the market rate into a incorrect decimals.

```solidity
uint256 marketRate;
address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(address(bondToken), USD);
if (feed != address(0)) {
    marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD)
    .normalizeAmount(
        getOracleDecimals(address(bondToken), USD), 
>       oracleDecimals // this is the decimals of the reserve token chainlink feed
    );
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Bond token is listed on Aerodrome, so it has the price oracle setup.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user tries to redeem some bond tokens using.

### Attack Path

- Assume, `marketRate` of Bond token is 95 USD, while the `redeemRate` calculated in the contract is 100 USD.
- With correct implementation, final redeem rate has to be 95 USD.
- But with decimals, `marketRate` is `95e8` and `redeemRate` is `100e6`, which is smaller than `marketRate`.
- As a result, the final redemption rate becomes `100 USD`.

### Impact

- Users redeem more reserve tokens than expected when current market rate is smaller than built-in redeem rate.
- It causes loss to protocol since it affects TVL.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

The decimal conversion has to be modified so that it converts `marketRate` into 6 decimals, not oracle decimals.

```diff
uint256 marketRate;
address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(address(bondToken), USD);
if (feed != address(0)) {
    marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD)
    .normalizeAmount(
        getOracleDecimals(address(bondToken), USD), 
-       oracleDecimals // this is the decimals of the reserve token chainlink feed
+       6
    );
}
```
