# Auction cannot end.

### Summary

The auction cannot end because of an incorrect period lookup during the `endAuction` call.

### Root Cause

When `startAuction` is called the contract deploys auction for the `currentPeriod`. Let's assume the `currentPeriod` is `1` and the `auctions[1]` is deployed.

After that, the call to `increaseIndexedAssetPeriod` is made. This will increase the `currentPeriod` to `2`.

Time passes and it's time to successfully end an auction.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L345

This makes a call to `transferReserveToAuction`. This will get the `currentPeriod` which is `2` and check the `auctions[2]` to get an auction address. The auction address doesn't exist and it's `address(0)`. The auction will be unable to end as `address(0)` is not the `msg.sender`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L579

This will leave the auction in a `BIDDING` state forever and bids cannot be claimed or refunded.

To `claimBid` it requires for the auction to expire and to succeed, it did not succeed as it is stuck in the `BIDDING` state.

To `claimRefund` it requires the auction to expire and to fail, it did not fail as it is stuck in the `BIDDING` state.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path
The normal flow of auction:
1.) startAuction
2.) bid
3.) endAuction

### Impact

The protocol will be stuck after the first auction is supposed to end. The auction state is stuck in the `BIDDING` state and users' bids are lost and cannot be reclaimed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Inside the transferReserveToAuction it should lookup the auction for the currentPeriod -1

```diff
function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
  (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
+ address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod - 1];
- address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
  require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
  
  IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
