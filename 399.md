# Lowest bid can be ousted by attacker as bid not verified after scaling, leading to eventual DoS

## Summary
[This piece of logic in `insertSortedBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L200-L206) needs to be re-validated and values updated _after_ `removeExcessBids()` [has been called inside `bid()` here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L161):
```js
        // Compare prices without division by cross-multiplying (it's more gas efficient)
        leftSide = newSellCouponAmount * currentBuyReserveAmount;
        rightSide = currentSellCouponAmount * newBuyReserveAmount;

        if (leftSide > rightSide || (leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount > currentSellCouponAmount)) {
          break;
        }
```

In the current implementation, anyone's lowest bid can be removed and replaced by an attacker's bid of exactly the same "rate" and "volume" over & over again.

## Description
- `Attack Path 01` outlines the basic vulnerability. 
- `Attack Path 02` and `Attack Path 03` show variations of it which cause a greater impact.
- `Attack Path 04` shows how it can be weaponized to DoS the entire auction functionality.

### Attack Path 01 ( _See `PoC_01` for a coded test case_ )
1. We'll denote a bid by using the syntax: `(100, 2)` which denotes `(buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount)` i.e. user is willing to pay `sellCouponAmount` USD to buy `buyReserveAmount` reserve tokens.
2. **Setup:** For ease of calculation, let's assume `totalBuyCouponAmount = 12` and `maxBids = 6` which gives us the `slotSize = 12 / 6 = 2`.
3. Alice the honest user bids `(2, 6)`. Rate = `6 / 2 = 3`. Another bid with `sellCouponAmount = 6` is required to reach `totalBuyCouponAmount`.
4. Bob (or Alice again) bids `(12, 12)`. Rate = `12 / 12 = 1`. Since `sellCouponAmount` of `12` is greater than 6 and the rate is lower than Alice's bid, the bid is automatically reduced by the protocol to `(6, 6)`. We've now reached the `totalBuyCouponAmount` limit.
5. Now in order for any of these 2 bids to be replaced, one would expect only a higher bid to do so. Unfortunately, this is not the case currently.
6. Attacker chooses to replace Bob's bid.
7. Attacker bids `(10, 10)` confident of the fact that only 6 sellCouponAmount of his will be used to compete with Bob's bid, as Alice's bid rate is higher. Since Bob's bid was scaled down to `(6, 6)`, [this piece of logic in `insertSortedBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L200-L206) considers attacker's bid to be greater as `10 > 6` i.e. `leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount > currentSellCouponAmount`.
8. Bob's bid is entirely removed and replaced by the attacker's which is **then** scaled down to `(6, 6)` and the remaining 4 sellCouponAmount is refunded to the attacker.
9. Effectively, the attacker could replace the lowest bid by spending exactly the same coupons and buying exactly the same reserve tokens. FIFO wasn't respected.

This problem goes on and on until the end of the auction because now some other actor say, `Attacker_2` can do the same to the old attacker's bid. 

**It may already be obvious** that the Attacker needs a condition where `totalBuyCouponAmount` limit has been reached. This allows them to post a "higher bid" by bidding `(X, totalBuyCouponAmount)` and ousting the earlier bid. This gives rise to the below mentioned variations.


### Attack Path 02 ( _See `PoC_02` for a coded test case_ )
1. What if Alice has placed a bid which fills up all the slots? Something like `(48, 12)` i.e. the bid has `sellCouponAmount = totalBuyCouponAmount`. How can the Attacker now oust her bid? There's no scaling down yet so it seems the only way to oust this bid completely is to genuinely post a higher bid. Unfortunately, there is still a way.
2. Attacker bids _slightly higher_ for just one slot by bidding `(9, 2)`. This results in Alice's bid to be scaled down to make room for the attacker's bid. Alice's bid now looks something like `(40, 10)`.
3. Attacker can now, just as before, bid `(48, 12)` (effectively the same rate) and be fully confident in the fact that their bid will be scaled down to `(40, 10)` (effectively same volume) while ousting Alice's bid comepletely.
4. The difference between this and `Attack Path 01` is the additional cost of posting that first higher bid to manipulate the pre-conditions.


### Attack Path 03
1. This one is not an attack path per se but more like a design decision which the protocol has taken. What if there's only one bid by Alice where `sellCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount`?. Something like `(40, 10)`.
2. The Attacker can simply post a bid with the same rate but higher volume since slots are available. They just need to make sure `sellCouponAmount = totalBuyCouponAmount` in their bid. Like `(48, 12)`. Alice's entire bid will be ousted and replaced by this new one.
3. To carry out this "attack", the Attacker should be willing to buy all the slots at the current lowest rate i.e. buy higher volume at the same rate.


### Attack Path 04 (Auction DoS)
1. Now that we have seen that **ANY state** of the bid list can be manipulated to a state where the lowest bid can be repeatedly replaced, this opens up an attack vector to DoS the entire auction permanently such that honest users won't be able to place any bids. This can happen because `lastBidIndex` is a `uint256` and is [continually incremented](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L143-L146).
2. Let's continue from where we left off in `Attack Path 02` (_the starting point can be anything really_). The bid list comprises of 2 bids by the attacker. One slot has the high bid and the remaining slots have the lower bid.
3. Since the lower bid is always scaled down and covers a coupon amount less that `totalBuyCouponAmount`, Attacker can run a loop which keeps on replacing his own lowest bid by bidding `(X, totalBuyCouponAmount)`. Here `X` is whatever the current lowest `buyReserveAmount` is. The attacker always gets refunded for the ousted bid so the attack cost is the final bid cost and gas.
4. Eventually `lastBidIndex` reaches `type(uint256).max` and the attacker stops. 
5. The bid list is now effectively frozen since no new users can post a bid as it will result in `lastBidIndex` to overflow


## Proofs of Concept
First, change the config values inside `setUp()` of `Auction.t.sol` (just for easier visualization; the issue is present even with the original values):
```diff
  function setUp() public {
    usdc = new Token("USDC", "USDC", false);
    weth = new Token("WETH", "WETH", false);
    
    pool = createPool(address(weth), address(usdc));
    useMockPool(pool);

    vm.startPrank(pool);
    auction = Auction(Utils.deploy(
      address(new Auction()),
      abi.encodeWithSelector(
        Auction.initialize.selector,
        address(usdc),
        address(weth),
-       1000000000000,
+       12, // totalBuyCouponAmount
        block.timestamp + 10 days,
-       1000,
+       6, // maxBids
        house,
        110
      )
    ));
    vm.stopPrank();
  }
```

    auction.bid(2, 6); 
    console.log("alice low bid");
    auction.bid(12, 12); 
    vm.stopPrank();

    address attacker = makeAddr("Attacker");
    vm.startPrank(attacker);

Add this test and run with `forge test --mt test_2_bidOusted_bug -vvvv` to see it pass:
```js
  function test_2_bidOusted_bug() public {
    vm.startPrank(bidder); // honest bidder
    usdc.mint(bidder, 100);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), type(uint256).max);
    console.log("alice low bid");
    auction.bid(12, 12); 
    vm.stopPrank();

    address attacker = makeAddr("Attacker");
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    usdc.mint(attacker, 100);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), type(uint256).max);

    console.log("attacker high bid");
    auction.bid(2, 6); 
    console.log("attacker low bid");
    auction.bid(12, 12); 
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
    vm.prank(pool);
    auction.endAuction();

    assertEq(uint256(auction.state()), uint256(Auction.State.SUCCEEDED));
    console.log("auction succeeded");
  }
```

## Mitigation 
- Option1:
  - As mentioned in the summary section, we need to do the comparison & re-validations again **after** the scaling down of the new bid has been done, to get an accurate picture.

- Option2:
  - The following fix seems to make the current issue go away. I haven't tested this for all the other scenarios, so please run a regression suite over this.
```diff
  function insertSortedBid(uint256 newBidIndex) internal {
    Bid storage newBid = bids[newBidIndex];
    uint256 newSellCouponAmount = newBid.sellCouponAmount;
    uint256 newBuyReserveAmount = newBid.buyReserveAmount;
    uint256 leftSide;
    uint256 rightSide;

    if (highestBidIndex == 0) {
      // First bid being inserted
      highestBidIndex = newBidIndex;
      lowestBidIndex = newBidIndex;
    } else {
      uint256 currentBidIndex = highestBidIndex;
      uint256 previousBidIndex = 0;

      // Traverse the linked list to find the correct spot for the new bid
      while (currentBidIndex != 0) {
        // Cache the current bid's data into local variables
        Bid storage currentBid = bids[currentBidIndex];
        uint256 currentSellCouponAmount = currentBid.sellCouponAmount;
        uint256 currentBuyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount;
        uint256 currentNextBidIndex = currentBid.nextBidIndex;

        // Compare prices without division by cross-multiplying (it's more gas efficient)
        leftSide = newSellCouponAmount * currentBuyReserveAmount;
        rightSide = currentSellCouponAmount * newBuyReserveAmount;

-       if (leftSide > rightSide || (leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount > currentSellCouponAmount)) {
+       if (
+         leftSide > rightSide 
+         || (leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount > currentSellCouponAmount && currentCouponAmount == totalBuyCouponAmount && currentBidIndex != lowestBidIndex)
+         || (leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount > currentSellCouponAmount && currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount)
+       ) {
          break;
        }
        
        previousBidIndex = currentBidIndex;
        currentBidIndex = currentNextBidIndex;
      }

      if (previousBidIndex == 0) {
        // New bid is the highest bid
        newBid.nextBidIndex = highestBidIndex;
        bids[highestBidIndex].prevBidIndex = newBidIndex;
        highestBidIndex = newBidIndex;
      } else {
        // Insert bid in the middle or at the end
        newBid.nextBidIndex = currentBidIndex;
        newBid.prevBidIndex = previousBidIndex;
        bids[previousBidIndex].nextBidIndex = newBidIndex;
        if (currentBidIndex != 0) {
          bids[currentBidIndex].prevBidIndex = newBidIndex;
        }
      }

      // If the new bid is inserted at the end, update the lowest bid index
      if (currentBidIndex == 0) {
        lowestBidIndex = newBidIndex;
      }
    }

    // Cache the lowest bid's data into local variables
    Bid storage lowestBid = bids[lowestBidIndex];
    uint256 lowestSellCouponAmount = lowestBid.sellCouponAmount;
    uint256 lowestBuyReserveAmount = lowestBid.buyReserveAmount;

    // Compare prices without division by cross-multiplying (it's more gas efficient)
    leftSide = newSellCouponAmount * lowestBuyReserveAmount;
    rightSide = lowestSellCouponAmount * newBuyReserveAmount;

    if (leftSide < rightSide || (leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount < lowestSellCouponAmount)) {
      lowestBidIndex = newBidIndex;
    }
  }
