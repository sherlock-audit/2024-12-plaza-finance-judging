# Excess tokens are not refunded when joining balancer pool using `EXACT_BPT_OUT` `JoinKind`

### Summary

If users deposit to the PreDeposit or Plaza via `BalancerRouter` and specify `EXACT_BPT_OUT` as the desired `JoinKind`, all the excess transferred tokens will remain stuck in the `BalancerRouter`, instead of being transferred back to the user.

### Root Cause

In `BalancerRouter`'s [`joinBalancerPool`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/ab5bbd7d54042e4444b711a32def5b639fbd63b4/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L65), `maxAmountsIn` for each token will be transferred from the user  to the router. Then, the balancer pool will be joined, and the corresponding Balancer pool tokens will be obtained:

```solidity
// File: BalancerRouter.sol

function joinBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        // Transfer assets from user to this contract
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]); 
        }

        IVault.JoinPoolRequest memory request = IVault.JoinPoolRequest({
            assets: assets,
            maxAmountsIn: maxAmountsIn,
            userData: userData,
            fromInternalBalance: false
        });

        // Join Balancer pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        balancerVault.joinPool(poolId, address(this), address(this), request);
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        return balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter - balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore;
    }
```

The problem with the current logic is that the router does not consider that users can be depositing specifying `TOKEN_IN_FOR_EXACT_BPT_OUT`/`ALL_TOKENS_IN_FOR_EXACT_BPT_OUT` as the `JoinKind` in Balancer.

The [`userData` field is a flexible field](https://docs-v2.balancer.fi/reference/joins-and-exits/pool-joins.html#maxamountsin) that allows Balancer depositors to encode specific data when joining a Balancer pool. From Balancer docs: *“For joins, userData encodes a `JoinKind` to tell the pool what style of join you're performing.”.*

There are two specific `JoinKind`s where a **user can specify the exact BPT amount of tokens they want, by depositing an unknown amount of tokens.**

The problem with `joinBalancerPool` is that in case a user specifies one of these exact `BPT` out `JoinKinds` (which is possible as both `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` and `joinBalancerAndPlaza` allow the depositor to pass an arbitrary `userData`), the remaining assets that haven’t been fully traded will remain stuck in the router, instead of being transferred back to the user.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `joinBalancerAndPredeposit` to deposit into a `WETH/rETH` Balancer pool and immediately deposit into the `PreDeposit` contract. He sets a `userData` with a `JoinKind` specifying `ALL_TOKENS_IN_FOR_EXACT_BPT_OUT`.
2. Because it is not possible the exact needed amount of deposit tokens prior to the transaction actually being executed, the user passes an estimated `maxAmountsIn` so that it is guaranteed that the `joinPool` transaction will not revert due to not enough tokens being deposited for the required exact `BPT` amount requested. Then, `maxAmountsIn` specified for both `WETH` and `rETH` are transferred to the `BalancerRouter`. Note that the rate could change by a lot between sending the transaction and the transaction being executed, potentially requiring far less tokens than the initially expected to fulfill the desired BPT token amount.
3. When the Balancer pool is joined, not all the transferred `WETH` and `rETH` has actually been used to join the pool. However, the `BalancerRouter` contract ignores this surplus, so it remains stuck forever in the router instead of being transferred back to the user.

### Impact

For pool joins where a user desires an `EXACT_BPT_OUT`, it is reasonable to believe that users will be willing to set a higher `maxAmountsIn` reasonable with slippage but still knowing that it is big enough so that the exact requested BPT tokens are obtained. Note that this **is not a user error**, but a necessary action in order to guarantee that the expected BPT tokens will be obtained (from [Balancer docs](https://docs-v2.balancer.fi/reference/joins-and-exits/pool-joins.html#maxamountsin): “… *it's possible for token amounts to change in the pool between the time you send your transaction and when your transaction executes*”).

Because of this, all `EXACT_BPT_OUT` joins will always leave some amounts stuck forever in the `BalancerRouter`. The amounts may vary depending on the user but can accumulate significantly over time, and the issue does not require external limitations as it is based on flawed logic in the contract who fails to refund the corresponding amounts.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider refunding the excess of undeposited `assets` to the user after joining the Balancer pool.
