# `OracleReader` Fails to Validate That Oracle Price (`answer`) Is Greater Than Zero

### Summary

The `OracleReader` contract retrieves price data from Chainlink oracles using the `latestRoundData()` function. However, it does not validate that the returned price (`answer`) is greater than zero. While Chainlink guarantees non-negative prices for crypto assets, a zero value is possible. Failure to validate this can lead to incorrect calculations in the protocol, especially when creating or redeeming `bondETH` or `levETH`. This issue could result in financial losses for users or for the protocol.  

### Root Cause

In  [`OracleReader.sol::68-75`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L68-L75) `getOraclePrice` function lacks a check to ensure that the `answer` returned by the `latestRoundData()` function is greater than zero. This omission allows the protocol to proceed with zero or negative values (negative probably won't happen but still we shouldn't rely on assumptions but rather than we should verify answer > 0), leading to incorrect operations.  

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Returned price from Chainlink oracle is 0

### Attack Path

1. The Chainlink oracle returns a zero price (`answer`) for an asset
2. The `getOraclePrice` function uses the zero value without validation. 
3.  This results in:  
   - Incorrect price calculations for `bondETH` or `levETH`.  
   - Users potentially receiving more or less than their due value when creating or redeeming assets.  
   - Protocol harm due to unexpected or incorrect state changes caused by invalid prices.  

### Impact

- **User Impact:** Users may lose funds due to incorrect pricing calculations.  
- **Protocol Impact:** The protocol could face financial harm or state inconsistencies.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a validation check in the `getOraclePrice` function to ensure that `answer` is greater than zero:  

```diff
 (, int256 answer,, uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();  

+    if (answer <= 0) {  
+       revert IncorrectPrice();  
+  }  
```
