# Auction cannot complete successfully due to period mismatch between Pool and BondToken contracts

### Summary

A period tracking misalignment between Pool.sol and BondToken.sol will cause auction completion to fail for all users as the auction contract will be unable to access the Pool's transferReserveToAuction function due to period verification failure.

### Root Cause

In Pool.sol's `startAuction()`, the auction address is stored for the current period before incrementing the period via `bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod()`. However, when the auction tries to complete, `transferReserveToAuction()` checks against the new (incremented) period:

```solidity
// Pool.sol
function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    // ...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An auction must be started via Pool's `startAuction()`
2. The auction period must have expired (`block.timestamp >= endTime`)
3. The auction must be in `State.BIDDING`
4. `currentCouponAmount >= totalBuyCouponAmount` (not undersold)
5. `totalSellReserveAmount < (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100` (within pool sale limit)

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Pool's `startAuction()` is called, storing auction address in `auctions[N]` where N is the current period
2. `bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod()` is called, incrementing period to N+1
3. When auction conditions are met and `endAuction()` is called:
    - State checks pass
    - Auction attempts to call `pool.transferReserveToAuction()`
    - `transferReserveToAuction()` gets current period (N+1)
    - Looks up `auctions[N+1]` which returns address(0)
    - `require(msg.sender == auctionAddress)` fails
4. Auction cannot complete successfully

### Impact

The protocol's auction mechanism becomes completely non-functional. Users cannot complete auctions successfully, leading to:

- Coupon tokens being permanently locked in auction contracts
- Reserve tokens being unable to be transferred
- Every auction being forced to remain in BIDDING state or fail

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `transferReserveToAuction` function to check the previous period's auction, since the auction was created one period before the current period:

```solidity
// Pool.sol
function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod - 1]; 
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());

    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
