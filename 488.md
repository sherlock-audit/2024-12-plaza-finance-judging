# Library `ERC20Extensions` can induce error

### Summary

Both functions in `ERC20Extensions` implement a Try&Catch method. However, there is no apparent reason for either of the "Try" conditions to fail unless if the input IERC20 `token` is invalid. But if this is the case neither of these two functions will identify the issue but return a value instead.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This implementation can do more damage than good, as it can allow for a wrong or even malicious token contract to be used in this protocol, by hiding what would be a error revert.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider getting rid of the try&catch altogether.
