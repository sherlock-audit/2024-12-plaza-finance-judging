# Missing slippage protection in `BalancerRouter`

### Summary

In `BalancerRouter`, users would first join the Balancer pool to get LP tokens, then either pre-deposit or directly deposit into Plaza pool. However, there lacks slippage protection on the amount of LP tokens minted for user, especially in the pre-deposit function.

### Root Cause

[`joinBalancerPool`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L65C1-L90C6) is called internally and work as entry point to first get Balancer LP tokens. In the function, we see no minimum LP tokens out is ever checked, and all those value will immediately be used for next step's deposit.

```solidity
    function joinBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        // Transfer assets from user to this contract
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]);
        }

        IVault.JoinPoolRequest memory request = IVault.JoinPoolRequest({
            assets: assets,
            maxAmountsIn: maxAmountsIn,
            userData: userData,
            fromInternalBalance: false
        });

        // Join Balancer pool
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        balancerVault.joinPool(poolId, address(this), address(this), request);
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter = balancerPoolToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        return balancerPoolTokenBalanceAfter - balancerPoolTokenBalanceBefore;
    }
```

From the other two functions, we can see that when joining Plaza pools, there will be an `minPlazaTokens` working as a type of slippage protection mechanism, but in `joinBalancerAndPredeposit`, there is no such check, meaning users can potentially be subjected to unexpected slippage loss.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

1. Alice wants to pre-deposit 1000 worth of LP tokens
2. Due to unexpected other transactions and market reasons, 950 LP tokens are minted for her
3. Alice wants to take at least 970 LP tokens, but there is nothing she can do, and she will get less LP tokens than desired, and for further deposits.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Slippage can happen, and cause user to lose funds unexpectedly, either due to intentional transaction or not.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding min LP token for Balancer pools as well.
