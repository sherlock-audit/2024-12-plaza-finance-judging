# Attacker will exploit deposit and withdrawal flexibility to disrupt the protocol and manipulate token distribution

### Summary

The `PreDeposit` contract allows users to deposit `reserveToken` up to a specified `reserveCap` during the deposit period. However, users can freely withdraw their deposits during this time. An attacker can exploit this mechanism by monopolizing the `reserveCap`, preventing other users from depositing. By withdrawing their deposit before the period ends (or leaving only a negligible amount), the attacker can either nullify the contractâ€™s functionality or claim an unfair proportion of `userBondShare` and `userLeverageShare`. This behavior severely impacts the protocol and undermines trust..

### Root Cause

On the line [PreDeposit.sol#L119](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L119), it is checked whether the total amount of reserve tokens has reached `reserveCap`.

And users can freely withdraw their deposits during the deposit period.

### Attack Path

#### Path 1:
- Attacker deposits `reserveCap` early in the deposit period,  preventing others from participating.
- Just before the deposit period ends, the attacker withdraws all but a negligible amount (e.g., 1 wei) of their deposit.
- The `reserveAmount` becomes `1`, but the contract logic for `userBondShare` and `userLeverageShare` remains based on the full `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount`.
- Attacker claims nearly all `userBondShare` and `userLeverageShare` with an insignificant remaining deposit, or prevents the pool from being created entirely by withdrawing all funds.

#### Path 2:
1. The attacker withdraws all funds (`reserveAmount = 0`) before the deposit period ends.
2. This nullifies the pool creation process entirely.

### Impact

Attacker can prevent the creation of the pool, stalling protocol functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Prevent free withdrawals by setting a separate withdrawal period.
2. Set a minimum amount of `reserveToken` for pool creation
