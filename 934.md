# Incorrect price for negative ticks due to improper rounding

### Summary

Incorrect handling of negative tick values in the calculation of `getSqrtTwapX96 ` in the `latestRoundData ` function of the `BondOracleAdapter ` contract due to Solidity's integer division truncation will cause an inaccurate price calculation.





### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L109-L111  there is an incorrect handling of negative tick values due to Solidity's integer division truncation. When the difference between the two tickCumulatives is positive, truncation decreases the tick value. If it's negative and does not divide evenly by `twapInterval`, truncation increases the tick value. The current implementation does not adjust the TWAP value when the difference between the two tickCumulatives is negative, which results in an inaccuracy in the calculated TWAP value.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The function `latestRoundData` may return an incorrect price

### PoC

If 
```js
uint32 public twapInterval = 1800; // 30 minutes
int24 tick = -4500 / 1800; // using -4500 as it doesn't divide evenly
// -4500 divided by 1800 results in -2.5, which becomes -2 after truncation in Solidity
```
Since  -2 > -2.5 this rounding up leads to inaccurate pricing for negative ticks, potentially affecting the protocol's functionality.



### Mitigation

Create the following check before using the difference between the 2 tickCumulatives values:

```js
int24 tick = int24((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int56(uint56(twapInterval)));

if ((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) < 0 && ((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) % int56(uint56(twapInterval)) != 0)) {
      tick--;
}

uint160 getSqrtTwapX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(tick);
```
