# Users can grief by claiming coupons without providing liquidity for a substantial amount of time

### Summary

The shares calculation mechanism doesn't take into account the amount of time a user has owned bond tokens, which results in malicious actors being able to claim coupons without providing liquidity to the pool for a meaningful amount of time.

### Root Cause

In `BondToken.sol` to see the shares a user is eligible to, the function [getIndexedUserAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L190) is used. It is also called when the user's shares are being updated if their balance changes. The method iterates over all the previous periods in which the balance hasn't changed and returns the accumulated shares over that time. However nothing stops a user from buying bond tokens at the end of the current period and selling them immediately when the next period starts thus being eligible for the shares without actually providing liquidity to the pool for a meaningful amount of time. If done by enough users, this could cause liquidity issues and lead to suspension of coupon distributions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.A pool which is approaching the end of it's current period.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.When nearing the end of the current period, a user buys let's say `100 Bond Tokens`
2.Once the new period has started, the malicious actor sells their Bond Tokens which results in [_update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L154) being called before the balance has been updated. This function increases the user's shares since the last updated period which is the previous one, based on their balance then(`100 Bond Tokens`).
3.The user has gotten their money back by selling their Bond Tokens and is eligible for the shares for them without providing liquidity to the pool for that period.

### Impact

User can grief the protocol which will lead to loss of funds for the protocol and could potentially cause the pool to stop coupon distribution in more extreme cases.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a mechanism to track if the users have actually provided liquidity for the given period.
