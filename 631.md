# Dynamic fee calculation based on poolReserves and lastFeeClaimTime results in unfair fee entitlement due to sudden reserve changes

### Summary

In Pool.sol, the `getFeeAmount()` function calculates fees dynamically based on the current `poolReserves` and the time elapsed since `lastFeeClaimTime`. This approach creates two fairness issues:

1. Fee Overestimation: A sudden large increase in `poolReserves` magnifies the entitled fees for as long as `lastFeeClaimTime` is not updated.
2. Fee Underestimation: A sudden large decrease in `poolReserves` reduces the entitled fees, even if reserves were high for most of the accrual period.

Both scenarios lead to unfair fee entitlement for the `feeBeneficiary`, depending on the timing and magnitude of changes in `poolReserves`.

### Root Cause

Dynamic Fee Basis:
- `poolReserves` is dynamically calculated as `IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, which changes due to interactions like `simulateCreate()` or `simulateRedeem()`.
- This dynamic basis introduces inconsistencies in fee accrual, as `getFeeAmount()` relies on the current `poolReserves` value.

```solidity
  function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }
```
The calculation accrues fees over time, but it does not account for how `poolReserves` fluctuated during that time period. A single large change in reserves (e.g., a large deposit or withdrawal) can disproportionately impact the fee calculation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Dynamic Reserve Balance:
- `poolReserves` fluctuates due to deposits, redemptions, and possibly other interactions.
Delayed Fee Claims:
- The longer the delay between fee claims, the more significant the impact of fluctuating reserves on fee accrual.

### External Pre-conditions

External user actions, such as large redemptions or deposits, can drastically alter `poolReserves`.

### Attack Path

1. A user performs multiple `create()` and `redeem()` transactions, during which fees are correctly deducted from the `poolReserves` in these transactions to determine `amount` or `reserveAmount` for slippage protection.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433

```solidity
   poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
```
2. `poolReserves` fluctuates due to additional deposits or redemptions by other users, impacting the balance of the reserve token. Let's say a large deposit is made via `create()`, significantly increasing `poolReserves`.

3. Before any further transactions occur, `claimFees()` is called and `getFeeAmount()` calculates an inflated fee entitlement due to the sudden increase in reserves and the prolonged period since `lastFeeClaimTime`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L718-L720

```solidity
  function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }
```
4. Similarly, if `poolReserves` were large for a prolonged period and suddenly decreased, the `feeBeneficiary` would underclaim fees, leading to lost protocol revenue.
 
5. This results in:
- Overestimating entitled fees if `poolReserves` has increased.
- Underestimating entitled fees if `poolReserves` has decreased.

### Impact

The `feeBeneficiary` may receive more or less than the supposed fees, leading to revenue discrepancies for the protocol and making it difficult to trace the actual fees entitled to the protocol. Overestimating fees may cause user dissatisfaction while underestimating fees causes protocol losses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a mechanism to cache and accumulate the fees deducted during `create()` and `redeem()` transactions directly into a `feeAccumulator` variable. This ensures that the total fees entitled to the `feeBeneficiary` are accurately tracked over time, independent of `poolReserves` fluctuations.

Where possible, introduce a timeframe snapshot mechanism (similar to the Synthetic Logic) also that captures the fee accrual over discrete time intervals.
