# Function `transferReserveToAuction` will fail since it's not uses previous auction

### Summary

The root cause is that `startAuction` increments `currentPeriod` by calling `bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken)` after deploying an auction and storing it in the auctions mapping. When `transferReserveToAuction` is called during endAuction, it uses the incremented currentPeriod to look up the auction address in the auctions mapping. This results in `address(0)` being returned, causing the `CallerIsNotAuction` error.

### Root Cause

1. The `startAuction` function increments currentPeriod after storing the auction address in the auctions mapping.
2. The `transferReserveToAuction` function uses the incremented currentPeriod, which no longer corresponds to the active auction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `startAuction` is called, deploying a new auction and incrementing currentPeriod.
2. `endAuction` is called after the auction period ends.
3. `transferReserveToAuction` is invoked during the endAuction process.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The auction period must pass, triggering the call to endAuction.
2. The auction contract must attempt to claim reserve tokens from the pool.

### Attack Path

1. An external actor starts an auction by calling `startAuction`.
2. The auction completes, and `endAuction` is triggered.
3. The auction contract attempts to claim reserve tokens via `transferReserveToAuction`.
4. The call fails because currentPeriod in the auctions mapping refers to `address(0)` due to the increment in `startAuction`.

### Impact

The auction contract cannot claim reserve tokens from the pool, leading to a failed auction settlement. This disrupts the auction process and causes loss of functionality for users relying on the auction mechanism.

### PoC

Following PoC test proves that:

```solidity
    function testTransferReserveToAuction() public {
        Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);

        vm.startPrank(governance);
        rToken.mint(governance, 10000001000);
        rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 10000000000);

        Pool _pool = Pool(
            poolFactory.createPool(
                params,
                10000000000,
                10000,
                10000,
                "",
                "",
                "",
                "",
                false
            )
        );
        uint256 initialBalance = 1000 * 10 ** 18;

        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(address(_pool));
        _pool.bondToken().mint(user, initialBalance);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.prank(governance);
        _pool.setAuctionPeriod(10 days);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 days);
        _pool.startAuction();

        uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(_pool.auctions(0)).totalBuyCouponAmount();

        vm.prank(_pool.auctions(0));
        vm.expectRevert(bytes4(keccak256("CallerIsNotAuction()")));
        _pool.transferReserveToAuction(couponAmountToDistribute);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Use the previous currentPeriod when calling `transferReserveToAuction` to ensure it references the correct auction. Update `transferReserveToAuction` as follows:

```solidity
function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    address auctionAddress = auctions[previousPeriod]; // Use the previous period
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());

    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
