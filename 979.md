# new aunctions might be stopped perpetually

### Summary

The startAuction function in Pool.sol is a permisionless function but may fails to process auctions perpetually if lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod is greater than block.timestamp. This can lead to the auction not starting as intended, causing operational disruptions.  this is possible if the starting of new aunction delayed by just 1 second leading to the a scenario where the validation fails and new aunctions can't commence

### Root Cause

Root cause is in Pool.sol which is used to facilitate new aunction contract.

 function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
    // Check if distribution period has passed
    require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod < block.timestamp, DistributionPeriodNotPassed());//bug

    // Check if auction period hasn't passed
    require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());  //if block.timestamp exceeds just a second be required, function reverts

    // Check if auction for current period has already started
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0), AuctionAlreadyStarted());


### Internal Pre-conditions

-The function is called when the contract is not paused.
-The lastDistribution, distributionPeriod, and auctionPeriod variables and their sum is less than the block.timestamp

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

-The function is called to start an auction.
-The require statement checks if lastDistribution + distributionPeriod < block.timestamp.
-If block.timestamp is only a second  greater than the sum of  "lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod", the auction fails to start.



### Impact

Dos.  New aunctions fails to start

### PoC






### Mitigation

Modify the require statement to use <= instead of < to ensure the auction can start if the block timestamp is higher than lastDistribution, distributionPeriod, and auctionPeriod.
