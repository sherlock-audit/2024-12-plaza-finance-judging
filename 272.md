# Auctions can always be gamed to end in FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT state

### Summary

`buyReserveAmount` is not checked against poolSaleLimit in every bid.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125

### Root Cause

Auctions can always be gamed to end in FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT state. This is due to buyReserveAmount not checked against poolSaleLimit in every bid. 

```solidity
 function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns(uint256) {
    if (sellCouponAmount == 0 || sellCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (buyReserveAmount == 0) revert BidAmountTooLow();
    if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh();

    // Transfer buy tokens to contract
```

The problem with this is that, sell Reserve token balance of the pool can be exceeded either deliberately or mistakenly... making auctions always end in `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` state.

```solidity
 function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;//@audit-issue Auctions can always be gamed to end in FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT state. This is due to buyReserveAmount not checked against poolSaleLimit in every bid. (Distribution of coupon tokens to bond token holders will always be rolled-over)
    } else {
```

This will result in Distribution of coupon tokens to bond token holders to always be rolled-over.. so bond token holders will always miss out on these distribution.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `buyReserveAmount` is not checked against poolSaleLimit in every bid.

### External Pre-conditions

sell Reserve token balance of the pool is exceeded either deliberately or mistakenly.

### Attack Path
Amount of `buyReserveAmount` in a bid makes `totalSellReserveAmount` exceed sell Reserve token balance of the pool

### Impact

`buyReserveAmount` is not checked against poolSaleLimit in every bid.

sell Reserve token balance of the pool is exceeded either deliberately or mistakenly making auctions always end in `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` state.


Distribution of coupon tokens to bond token holders will always be rolled-over

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check to Auction.bid to ensure `buyReserveAmount` won't make `totalSellReserveAmount` exceed sell Reserve token balance of the pool
