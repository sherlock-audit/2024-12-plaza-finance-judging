# Integer Division Truncation in Auction Slot Size Leads to Failed Coupon Payments

## Summary
The auction contract has a critical vulnerability in its slot size calculation mechanism that can lead to failed auctions and disrupted coupon payments. The issue stems from integer division truncation in the `slotSize()` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L382

```solidity
function slotSize() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return totalBuyCouponAmount / maxBids;
}
```

When `totalBuyCouponAmount` is not perfectly divisible by `maxBids`, valid bids may be rejected by the modulo check:

```solidity
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external {
    if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    // ...
}
```


The issue begins with valid bids being rejected due to the integer division truncation in `slotSize()`:

```solidity
function slotSize() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return totalBuyCouponAmount / maxBids;  // Truncates decimals
}
```

For example, with `totalBuyCouponAmount = 1000 USDC` and `maxBids = 3`, any bid of 334 USDC would be rejected here:

```solidity
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external {
    if (sellCouponAmount % 333 != 0) revert InvalidSellAmount(); // 333 is truncated slotSize
    // ...
}
```

When these bids are rejected, it prevents the auction from reaching its target `totalBuyCouponAmount`. According to the docs, these auctions specifically sell ETH-related assets to generate USDC for the fixed 2.50 USDC quarterly coupon payments to bondETH holders. The auction failure occurs here:

```solidity
function endAuction() external {
    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
        state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    }
    // No USDC is transferred to the beneficiary on failure
}
```

This means the protocol does not receive the USDC needed for that quarter's coupon payments to bondETH holders, forcing a delay until another auction can be attempted. Each rejected bid also reduces competition for the wstETH being sold, potentially leading to worse execution prices for the protocol.

## Recommended mitigation steps
1. Add initialization validation to ensure `totalBuyCouponAmount` is always divisible by `maxBids`:
```solidity
function initialize(
    uint256 _totalBuyCouponAmount,
    uint256 _maxBids,
    // other params...
) initializer public {
    require(_totalBuyCouponAmount % _maxBids == 0, "Amount must be divisible by maxBids");
    totalBuyCouponAmount = _totalBuyCouponAmount;
    maxBids = _maxBids;
    // ...
}
```

2. Add a public getter function to expose the minimum valid bid size:
```solidity
function getMinimumBidSize() public view returns (uint256) {
    return slotSize();
}
```

3. Implement bid size validation that ensures bids are at least the slot size but removes the strict modulo requirement:
```solidity
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external {
    if (sellCouponAmount < slotSize()) revert BidTooSmall();
    // ... rest of function
}
```

4. Add events for rejected bids to enable monitoring:
```solidity
event BidRejected(address bidder, uint256 amount, string reason);
```

These changes will maintain the benefits of the slot system while preventing unnecessary auction failures and disruptions to the protocol's core functionality.
