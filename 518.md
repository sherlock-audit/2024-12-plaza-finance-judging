# [0xgh0st] - An attacker can steal the pool depositors profit

### Summary

The calculation of user share from a pool rely on `bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)`, Which is can be manipulated using a flashloan.

The shares are calculated by the following formula.

We notice that there is no time factor that can prevent from creating and redeem in the same tx.

### Root Cause

Missing of time factor in redeem function.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker gets a flashloan.
2. The attacker makes a deposit to pool.
3. The attacker calls the `claim()` function to gets his shares.
4. The attacker redeem `bondToken`.
5. The attacker gets profit and returns the flash loan.

### Impact

• loss of profit from depositing by Pool providers.
• decreased motivation to use the pool.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I recommend that you use the time factor to prevent flash loan attacks.
