### Root Cause

### PoC

The PreDeposit contract will be deployed to allow users to deposit their reserve tokens. By depositing, users become eligible to claim Bond and Leverage tokens after the deposit period and during the distribution phase coupon tokens provided by bidders in the auction will be distributed to bond token holders. Importantly, bond token holders' shares will be updated during token transfers. If users claim their Bond tokens from the PreDeposit contract after deposit period, the rewards portion belonging to those users will remain in the Distributor contract.

Example Scenario:

Initial Deposits:

User A deposits 10 WETH into the PreDeposit contract.

User B also deposits 10 WETH into the PreDeposit contract.

The total Bond amount is 100.

Claiming Assets and Rewards:

After the deposit period:

User B claims their assets from the PreDeposit contract.

Rewards are distributed to bond token holders after one period.

User B claims their reward from the Distributor contract.

When User A claims their assets from the PreDeposit contract after distribution:

The PreDeposit’s share increases, as User A’s share becomes zero.

Only the PreDeposit contract can claim rewards from the Distributor contract.

Key Points:

Rewards for bond token holders are updated dynamically during token transfers.

Late claims by users result in the PreDeposit contract’s share increasing, making it the only entity eligible to claim the remaining rewards from the Distributor contract.  

### Impact
