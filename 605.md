# User can withdraw assets twice from Balancer Pool using a single deposit

### Summary

**BalancerRouter** contracts allows a user to withdraw assets from the Balancer pool twice for a single deposit in the `preDeposit` contract. This happens because the user receives both bond and leverage tokens in return for their deposit in the `preDeposit` contract, enabling them to call the `exitPlazaPool` function twice and withdraw the assets from the Balancer pool two times.



### Root Cause


In the [PreDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L177-L182) contract, the design decision to mint both `Bond` and `Leverage` tokens for a single deposit without implementing a mechanism to restrict their independent use in [exitPlazaPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L92) allows double withdrawal from the Balancer Pool. The `exitPlazaPool` function treats Bond and Leverage tokens as separate entities, enabling the exploitation.




### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user must successfully deposit assets into the **PreDeposit** contract.
2. The user must receive bond and leverage tokens for their deposit.



### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user call **joinBalancerAndPredeposit** function to deposits assets into the **PreDeposit** contract, receiving both `bond` and `leverage` tokens.
2. The user uses the **BalancerRouter** contract to call `exitPlazaPool()` with the bond tokens, withdrawing assets from the Balancer pool.
3. The user calls `exitPlazaPool()` again, this time with the leverage tokens, withdrawing assets from the Balancer pool a second time.
4. The user successfully extracts assets from the Balancer pool twice for a single deposit.



### Impact

The protocol suffers from double withdrawals for a Balancer Pool, leading to a significant loss of funds.  


### PoC

### Mitigation

Implement logic in the `PreDeposit` contract that allows users to choose which token they want to receive.
