# Coupon Tokens will become stuck Multiple Times in the Distributor Contract

### Summary

Wrong assumption and usage of bond supply would make the funds in the Distributor contract to be stuck multiple times and unable to be claimed by anyone else. 

### Root Cause

The protocol uses the bondSupply in the startAuction()  to calculate the amount of `couponAmountToDistribute`, which is what is used to determine how much the pool wants to make from `reservetoken` sales, if the auction were to succeed then, that amount would be transferred to the distributor, where bond token holders would be able to make their period claims, but some of that tokens would become stuck in the Distributor contract because of many system factors combining together 

This Issue can be divided into Two Section, the first one is based on user action, but the other has a large impact that is based on the first one 

Because the protocol has a `PreDeposit` contract that allows users to deposit reserve tokens before the start of a pool, and after creation they receive their Bond and Leverage tokens, but their is a nuance here the system does not force the user to claim their tokens, the tokens can still be in possession of the `PreDeposit` function, 

This creates the first issue 
- a user has bonds to claim at PreDeposit but he does not do it 
-  you could Make a user that does not claim their bond tokens at `PreDeposit` contract loose rewards for a couple periods, 
- For example if period 1 and 2 passed and now we are in period three, the users is supposed to claim payments for both periods, but two ways for him to loose his rewards 
 - a user transfers 1 wei of BOND to him, this updates his last Update period Three, which means that he cant claim the rewards for those two periods

 ```solidity
  function updateIndexedUserAssets(address user, uint256 balance) internal {
    uint256 period = globalPool.currentPeriod;
    uint256 shares = getIndexedUserAmount(user, balance, period);
    
    userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares = shares;
    userAssets[user].lastUpdatedPeriod = period;

    emit UpdatedUserAssets(user, period, shares);
  }
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L190

  function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }
```
 - This can also happen if he himself calls the claim() at period Three and his shares are calculated with his zero balance, according to the code he loose those rewards and the his last updated is set to period 3 loosing his rewards

This issue may be classied as his fault but This same, concept allows users to manipulate the amount that an auction is created with in createAuction(), the function uses the total supply of the bond() tokens to know how much to earn from an auction from a particular period, 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530
```solidity
function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
   ...More Code
    uint8 bondDecimals = bondToken.decimals();
    uint8 sharesDecimals = bondToken.SHARES_DECIMALS();
    uint8 maxDecimals = bondDecimals > sharesDecimals ? bondDecimals : sharesDecimals;

    uint256 normalizedTotalSupply = bondToken.totalSupply().normalizeAmount(bondDecimals, maxDecimals);
    uint256 normalizedShares = sharesPerToken.normalizeAmount(sharesDecimals, maxDecimals);

    // Calculate the coupon amount to distribute
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)
        .toBaseUnit(maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

    auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
      address(new Auction()),
      abi.encodeWithSelector(
        Auction.initialize.selector,
        address(couponToken),
        address(reserveToken),
        couponAmountToDistribute,
        block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
        1000,
        address(this),
        poolSaleLimit
      )
    );
```
but this system assumes that everyone has claimed and holds bond tokens, but some bond tokens still remains in distributor, which means that with all the facts, we will have funds stuck in the Distributor() contract with the following fact steps 

- you deposit in the PreDeposit() your bond is minted at once with all PARTICIPANTS
- you don't claim yours
- the first period is upon us and the the startAuction(), is called with the bond total supply and the sharesPerAmount used to, calculate the coupon amount has a target to make  
- the auction ends and the target is met and sent to the Distributor, this action is done over two periods, but since the previous problem, stated is that the users shares amount does not get the shares for the period they did not hold the BOND tokens, they cant claim this from the Distributor !
as shown below
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L78
```solidity
  function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
...snippet
uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
...
}
```
- so if the user share is a large amount like $20k they cant claim that and it gets stuck in the Distributor() and others cant claim it too. 
- This can keep happening for a long time as long as the user does not claim 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `PreDeposit` User does not claim his Bond Tokens on the Contract
2. Couple Period pass and he does not claim it still
3. The Bond supply does not reduce when he does not claim
4. Auctions start and succeed 

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Loss of funds for users
- Funds stuck in contract
- Loss of funds for Pool as The Pool has to keep selling off significant amount of reserve tokens to finance this money that is not being used and getting stuck

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There's no way to know if the bond supply is with real users or not when you call `bond.totalSupply`, but one way is to make claiming from the `PreDeposit` contract compulsory and if users don't claim you can transfer it to non claimers, so that there is a possibility that that balance can be used to calculate their shares which in turn creates an opportunity to retrieve any funds in the Distributor
