# Unchecked Transfer in `Auction.claimBid` Function

### Summary

The missing check on the return value of IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer in the Auction.claimBid function will cause a potential loss of funds for bidders as an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to disrupt token transfers.

### Root Cause

in [Auction.sol:L352-376](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L352-L376) In Auction.claimBid, the function ignores the return value of the transfer function when transferring tokens to the bidder. This is a mistake as it assumes the transfer will always succeed, which is not guaranteed. If the transfer fails, the function will not revert, and the bidder will not receive their tokens, while the contract state will incorrectly reflect that the tokens were successfully transferred.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The claimed flag for the bid must be false.


### External Pre-conditions

The sellReserveToken contract must not revert on transfer

### Attack Path

A user participates in the auction and wins, expecting to claim tokens via claimBid.
The transfer function fails silently due to insufficient balance or a non-standard ERC-20 implementation.
The claimed flag is set to true, and the user cannot retry claiming their tokens.
The contract and the user incorrectly assume the transfer succeeded, resulting in financial loss for the user.

### Impact

 Bidders may not receive their tokens, leading to a loss of funds and incorrect assumptions about the contract state.
Users being left without their expected tokens.
