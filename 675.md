# Incorrect handling of `marketRate` during redemption of leverage token

### Summary

During the redemption process, `marketRate` of bond token is fetched from the oracle, but it's mistakenly used for leverage token redemption.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from [simulateRedeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L443-L451) function, where it fetches price of bond token, regardless of input `tokenType`.

```solidity
uint256 marketRate;
address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(address(bondToken), USD);
if (feed != address(0)) {
    marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD)
    .normalizeAmount(
        getOracleDecimals(address(bondToken), USD), 
        oracleDecimals // this is the decimals of the reserve token chainlink feed
    );
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Bond tokens are listed on Aerodrome, thus having an oracle price feed.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user tries to redeem leverage tokens.

### Attack Path

- Bond token price usually stays at 100 USD.
- Assume, current leverage token price is higher than 100 USD, e.g. 120 USD, this usually happens when `leverageTokenSupply * 4 < bondTokenSupply`.
- When the user tries to redeem leverage tokens, the `redeemRate` is replaced with `marketRate` of bond token because it's smaller, which is 100 USD.
- As a result, the user redeems less amount of leverage tokens than expected.

### Impact

- Loss of funds for leverage token redeemers.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

When redeeming leverage tokens, `marketRate` should be zero, so replacement does not happen. Here's a possible fix in `simulateRedeem` function:

```diff
return getRedeemAmount(
    tokenType,
    depositAmount,
    bondSupply,
    levSupply,
    poolReserves,
    getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD),
    oracleDecimals,
-   marketRate,
+   tokenType == TokenType.BOND ? marketRate : 0
).normalizeAmount(COMMON_DECIMALS, IERC20(reserveToken).safeDecimals());
```
