# Incorrect Pool Type: StablePool Should Be Used Instead of WeightedPool in BalancerOracleAdapter.sol

### Summary

The BalancerOracleAdapter.sol contract uses a WeightedPool to calculate the price of LP tokens for the wstETH/stETH pair. However, in the Balancer protocol, wstETH/stETH pairs are classified as StablePools. Using the incorrect pool type results in inaccurate price calculations for LP tokens.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol#L95

`BalancerOracleAdapter.sol::latestRoundData()`:-

```javascript
    function latestRoundData() external view returns (uint80, int256, uint256, uint256, uint80) {
@>      IBalancerV2WeightedPool pool = IBalancerV2WeightedPool(poolAddress);
        .
        .
        .
    }
```

Since the reserveToken will be derived from a pool of assets like wstETH/stETH or wstETH/rETH, and these pools are categorized as StablePools in the Balancer protocol, the current implementation is incorrect. The contract assumes a WeightedPool model, leading to a flawed price calculation logic.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The Balancer pool is assumed to be a WeightedPool instead of a StablePool.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The oracle will compute LP token prices using a WeightedPool pricing model instead of a StablePool model.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the contract to use StablePool interfaces and methods for wstETH/stETH or wstETH/rETH pools instead of WeightedPool. This ensures accurate price calculations consistent with the Balancer protocol
