# Incorrect Period Index in `Pool.transferReserveToAuction` Will Block Coupon Distributions

### Summary

An off-by-one period index error in [`Pool.sol#L579`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L579) will cause complete failure of coupon distributions for bond holders as valid auctions cannot transfer reserves due to invalid sender verification

### Root Cause

In `Pool.sol#L578-L579` there is an incorrect period index used when validating auction calls. The `transferReserveToAuction` function checks auctions using the current period from `bondToken.globalPool()` after it was incremented by `startAuction()`, when it should use the previous period that the auction belongs to.

```solidity
  function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
@>  (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
@>  address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```
this function is called by the function `Auction.endAuction`, while the function `Pool.startAuction` is ealier called and increase the current period by 1:

```solidity
    // Pool.startAuction
    // ...
    auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
      address(new Auction()),
      abi.encodeWithSelector(
        Auction.initialize.selector,
        address(couponToken),
        address(reserveToken),
        couponAmountToDistribute,
        block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
        1000,
        address(this),
        poolSaleLimit
      )
    );

    // Increase the bond token period
@>  bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);
    // ...
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A valid auction must be started via `Pool.startAuction()` which increments `bondToken.currentPeriod`
2. The auction must successfully complete (reach `SUCCEEDED` state)
3. `Pool.distribute()` must be called after auction completion

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **User calls `Pool.startAuction()`**  
   - Creates auction for current period N  
   - Increases `bondToken.currentPeriod` to N+1  
   - Sets `auctions[N] = newAuctionAddress`

2. **Auction reaches end time successfully**  
   - Auction enters `SUCCEEDED` state  
   - Calls `Pool.transferReserveToAuction()`

3. **Pool checks auction validity using current period N+1**  
   - Looks up `auctions[N+1]` (uninitialized) instead of `auctions[N]`  
   - Reverts with `CallerIsNotAuction()` error

### Impact

**Bond holders cannot receive coupon distributions** as successful auctions cannot transfer reserves to complete the distribution process. This breaks core protocol functionality for all bond token holders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify `Pool.transferReserveToAuction` to use previous period:
```solidity
function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1; // Add this line
    address auctionAddress = auctions[previousPeriod]; // Modified line
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
