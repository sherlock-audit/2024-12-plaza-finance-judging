# BondToken Holders Will Not Receive Shares if an Auction Fails

### Summary

If an auction fails, a new auction cannot be initiated until the next distribution period ends. This happens because lastDistribution is updated to block.timestamp when the failed auction is initiated. Consequently, BondToken holders miss out on their share distributions until a significant delay has passed.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L532

```javascript
    function startAuction() external whenNotPaused {
@>      require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod < block.timestamp, DistributionPeriodNotPassed());
@>      require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());
        .
        .
        .
@>      lastDistribution = block.timestamp;
```
When startAuction() is called, lastDistribution is immediately updated to block.timestamp. If the auction fails, this update still persists, forcing the protocol to wait for the next distributionPeriod before attempting to restart the auction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

	1.	startAuction() is invoked, and an auction is initiated.
	2.	The auction fails due to external factors (e.g., insufficient participants or lack of bids).

### External Pre-conditions

	1.	lastDistribution is updated when the auction starts.
	2.	The protocol logic enforces a wait until the next distributionPeriod before a new auction can be created.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

	1.	BondToken holders will miss their share distributions for the failed auction period.
	2.	Protocol efficiency is reduced, and users may lose trust in the system due to unnecessary delays.
	3.	The auction mechanism becomes less responsive to failures, potentially affecting liquidity and token value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update Pool.sol::startAuction() to only update lastDistribution when the auction is successfully created.
