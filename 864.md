# Potential reedem rate rounding to zero

### Summary

Due to bad order of operations, redeem rate can be be rounded down to zero causing transactions reverting in otherwise normal conditions, especially in causes of low TVL value or high bond supply.

### Root Cause

[Pool::getRedeemAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L514) is used to calculate the redeem rate in leverage token types:

```solidity
  function getRedeemAmount(
    ...
  ) public pure returns(uint256) {
    ...
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
    ...
  }
```

In cases of low TVL or scenarios where `bondSupply` makes up a large part of the TVL, the `redeemRate` in this case will be rounded to zero as the `assetSupply` will undoubtedly be much larger. This leads to a loss of precision which wrongly calculates the redeem amount as zero, thus leading to the transaction reverting in the `_redeem()` function:

```solidity
  function _redeem(
   ...
   ) private returns(uint256) {
    // Get amount to mint
    uint256 reserveAmount = simulateRedeem(tokenType, depositAmount);

    // Check whether reserve contains enough funds
    if (reserveAmount < minAmount) {
      revert MinAmount();
    }

    // Reserve amount should be higher than zero
    if (reserveAmount == 0) {
      revert ZeroAmount();
    }

   ...
  }
```

### Impact

Inability for users to redeem in low TVL or mostly bonded markets
