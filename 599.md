# Missing Sequencer Uptime validation in `getOraclePrice()` allows exploitation of stale prices on Base

### Summary

The `getOraclePrice()` function fails to validate the Base sequencer's status before returning price data. On L2s like Base, the sequencer [can go down](https://status.base.org/incidents/vxbllbbfz4tb) which makes oracle data unreliable.

The contract should check both that the **sequencer is operational** (`status == 0`) and that sufficient time has passed since it resumed (`startedAt + GRACE_PERIOD < block.timestamp` where `GRACE_PERIOD` is generally set as `1 hour`) using [Chainlink's L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed](https://basescan.org/address/0xBCF85224fc0756B9Fa45aA7892530B47e10b6433) on Base. Without these checks, the protocol is vulnerable during sequencer downtime and the grace period after it resumes.

### Root Cause

The `getOraclePrice()` function does not perform any checks related to the Base sequencer:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L55-L76
```solidity
  function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns(uint256) {
    bool isInverted = false;
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(quote, base);
    
    if (feed == address(0)) {
      feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(base, quote);
      if (feed == address(0)) {
        revert NoFeedFound();
      }

      // Invert the price
      isInverted = true;
    }
    (,int256 answer,,uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
    
    if (updatedTimestamp + OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).feedHeartbeats(feed) < block.timestamp) {
      revert StalePrice();
    }

    uint256 decimals = uint256(AggregatorV3Interface(feed).decimals());
    return isInverted ? (10 ** decimals * 10 ** decimals) / uint256(answer) : uint256(answer);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

The sequencer must be down for some (any) period of time for prices therefore the Pool contract to become exploitable.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Missing sequencer checks on Base could allow oracle price returning stale prices during the sequencer downtime. Since the Pool contract uses these potentially stale prices for token minting and redemption calculations, an attacker could exploit the stale/incorrect prices to extract value from the protocol while the sequencer is down. This will also negatively impact ongoing auctions.

### PoC


Consider the following scenario:

1. The attacker holds a significant amount of derivative tokens (`BOND`or `LEVERAGE`).
2. They detect that the sequencer is down, leading to the oracle providing stale price data.
3. The attacker triggers the `redeem()` with the stale price.
4. The stale `getOraclePrice()` value inflates the `redeemRate`.
5. Then the attacker redeems derivative tokens for reserve tokens at an artificially high rate.

### Mitigation

Add checks in `getOraclePrice()` to check both that the **sequencer is operational** (`status == 0`) and that sufficient time has passed since it resumed (`startedAt + GRACE_PERIOD < block.timestamp` for a `GRACE_PERIOD` you wish) using [Chainlink's L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed](https://basescan.org/address/0xBCF85224fc0756B9Fa45aA7892530B47e10b6433) on Base.
