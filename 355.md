# Double-Spending Through Multiple Distribute() Calls Leading to Inflated Allocation

### Summary

The [`distribute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589 ) function lacks a timelock check to verify if the distribution period has passed. Unlike `startAuction,` which properly verifies time constraints, distribute can be called at any time after auction completion, potentially leading to premature distributions or double-claiming scenarios as there's no check to avoid calling the distribute function multiple times for the same period multiple times.
When `distribute()` is called multiple times for the same period, each call increases `couponAmountToDistribute` in the Distributor contract without any period tracking, allowing users to claim more rewards than intended.



### Root Cause

The distribute function:
1. Only checks if `currentPeriod` > 0
2. Doesn't verify if sufficient time has passed since last distribution
3. Lacks a mapping to track which periods have been distributed 
4. Missing proper time constraints unlike startAuction

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Multiple distributions could happen for the same period, Each call sends tokens and calls allocate()
allocate() keeps adding to couponAmountToDistribute
Users can claim based on this inflated couponAmountToDistribute


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add distribution period time check.
