# Pool's reserves can be drained if the coupon token is the same as reserve token.

## Bug description
> As per the protocol team, coupon token can be any ERC20, so it should be possible to have coupon token the same as reserve token.

When the auction succeeds, the `distribute()` function of the Pool contract can be called to transfer assets to the distributor contract for users to claim. 

[Pool.sol#L605-L611](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L605-L611)
```solidity
// Get Distributor
address distributor = poolFactory.distributors(address(this));
// Transfer coupon tokens to the distributor
IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(distributor, couponAmountToDistribute);
// Update distributor with the amount to distribute
Distributor(distributor).allocate(couponAmountToDistribute);
```

However, the contract fails to check if that function was already called for a given period, thus allowing it to be called an unlimited amount of times for the same period. It's not a problem when reserve and coupon tokens are two different assets, since the call to transfer would fail as the contract won't have enough funds, since they were already distributed in the first call. But if the coupon token is the same as the reserve token, the function would transfer assets that were already distributed yet again. This allows draining of the pool's reserves.

## Root cause
Not checking if the `distribute()` function has already been called for a given period.

## Attack path
1. Having coupon token the same as reserve token of the Pool.
2. Auction succeeds and `endAuction()` is called which transfers coupon tokens to the Pool.
3. `distribute()` is called for that period and coupon tokens are transferred to the distributor contract.
4. Users claim their share of transferred tokens for that period.
5. `distribute()` is called again for the same period and coupon tokens are transferred to the distributor.
6. Users claim their tokens for the same period again.

The above can be repeated until Pool's reserves are drained.

## Impact
Draining of the pool's reserves.

## Recommended Mitigation
Ensure `distribute()` can only be called once for a given period.
