# Double-Decrement in Auction Bid Accounting Leads to Incorrect Token Transfers and Failed Auctions

## Summary

The `bid` function in the Auction contract contains a state accounting vulnerability where it updates critical global accounting variables before validating if a bid will remain valid. Specifically, `currentCouponAmount` and `totalSellReserveAmount` are incremented when processing a bid, but may be incorrectly decremented again if the bid is later removed by `removeExcessBids()`:

```solidity
// In bid function
currentCouponAmount += sellCouponAmount;
totalSellReserveAmount += buyReserveAmount;

// Later in _removeBid if bid is removed 
currentCouponAmount -= sellCouponAmount;  
totalSellReserveAmount -= buyReserveAmount;
```

The bug occurs when a bid is initially accepted but later removed. Take this sequence:

1. A bid for 100 USDC sell amount (coupon) and 1 ETH buy amount (reserve) is submitted. Global state is updated:
```solidity
currentCouponAmount += sellCouponAmount; // adds 100 USDC
totalSellReserveAmount += buyReserveAmount; // adds 1 ETH
```

2. If `removeExcessBids()` removes this bid, `_removeBid()` decrements the same amounts:
```solidity 
currentCouponAmount -= sellCouponAmount; // subtracts 100 USDC again
totalSellReserveAmount -= buyReserveAmount; // subtracts 1 ETH again
```

3. This causes `currentCouponAmount` to be decremented twice for the same 100 USDC, leading to:
```solidity
if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
  state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD; // Triggers incorrectly if totalBuyCouponAmount was 1000 USDC 
                                 // and currentCouponAmount becomes 900 instead of 1000 after a removal
}
```

4. Similarly, `totalSellReserveAmount` becomes 1 ETH lower than actual bids would indicate:
```solidity
if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
  state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT; // Could wrongly pass this check if decremented below limit
}
```

5. Most importantly, in a successful auction:
```solidity
Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount); // Will transfer 1 ETH less than it should
                                                            // for each bid that was double-decremented
```

Each removed bid causes an additional decrement, so multiple removals compound the accounting error. For example, if 5 bids of 100 USDC/1 ETH each are removed, the state would be off by 500 USDC and 5 ETH, leading to significant underpayment in reserve token transfers.

## Impact

Each occurrence of a bid removal leads to a state accounting error that compounds in proportion to auction volume. When bids are removed near the `maxBids` limit or due to excess volume above `totalBuyCouponAmount`, both accounting variables are erroneously double-decremented. This directly affects:

1. Auction settlement through incorrect `FAILED_UNDERSOLD` state determination
2. Reserve token transfers in the Pool contract where `transferReserveToAuction()` is called by successful auctions to handle coupon distributions to bondETH holders 

The bug can manifest when:
- Auction volume is high enough to trigger bid removals (near `maxBids` or above `totalBuyCouponAmount`)
- Multiple bids need to be removed in sequence, as each removal compounds the accounting error
- The auction would otherwise succeed (already fails don't transfer tokens)

There are no meaningful mitigating factors since the auction's core accounting cannot be corrected once corrupted, and the error accumulates with each bid removal.


## Recommended mitigation steps
Update the bid logic to only modify state variables after confirming the bid will remain valid:

```solidity
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external returns(uint256) {
    // Input validation
    if (sellCouponAmount == 0 || sellCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    // ... other validation
    
    // Transfer tokens
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sellCouponAmount);
    
    // Create bid
    Bid memory newBid = Bid({...});
    uint256 newBidIndex = ++lastBidIndex;
    bids[newBidIndex] = newBid;
    bidCount++;
    
    // Process bid
    insertSortedBid(newBidIndex);
    if (bidCount > maxBids) {
        if (lowestBidIndex == newBidIndex) revert BidAmountTooLow();
        _removeBid(lowestBidIndex);
    }
    removeExcessBids();
    
    // Only update accounting if bid remains valid
    if (bids[newBidIndex].bidder != address(0)) {
        currentCouponAmount += sellCouponAmount;
        totalSellReserveAmount += buyReserveAmount;
        emit BidPlaced(newBidIndex, msg.sender, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);
        return newBidIndex;
    }
    
    revert BidAmountTooLow();
}
```
