# Dex pools' bondToken holdings causes incorrect coupon distribution amount calculations

### Summary

The protocol doesn't distinguish between bondTokens held by addresses that can claim coupons (regular users) and those that cannot (DEX pools). When calculating auction sizes and coupon distributions, it considers the total supply, including tokens in DEX pools that will never claim their share. This leads to oversized auctions selling more underlying tokens than necessary, increasing auction failure risk especially in bear markets, and ultimately preventing even active users from receiving their rightful coupons.

Consider the following:
```markdown
Total Supply: 1000 bondETH
- Regular Users: 200 (can claim)
- DEX Pools: 800 (cannot claim)
```

`couponAmountToDistribute` calculation in `startAuction()` function:
```solidity
    uint256 normalizedTotalSupply = bondToken.totalSupply().normalizeAmount(bondDecimals, maxDecimals);
    uint256 normalizedShares = sharesPerToken.normalizeAmount(sharesDecimals, maxDecimals);

    // Calculate the coupon amount to distribute
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)
        .toBaseUnit(maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
```

`claim()` function in `Distributor.sol`:
```solidity
  function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    BondToken bondToken = Pool(pool).bondToken();
    address couponToken = Pool(pool).couponToken();

    if (address(bondToken) == address(0) || couponToken == address(0)){
      revert UnsupportedPool();
    }

    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

    if (IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < shares) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesBalance();
    }
    
    // check if pool has enough *allocated* shares to distribute
    if (couponAmountToDistribute < shares) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesToDistribute();
    }

    // check if the distributor has enough shares tokens as the amount to distribute
    if (IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < couponAmountToDistribute) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesToDistribute();
    }

    couponAmountToDistribute -= shares;    
    bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
    
    emit ClaimedShares(msg.sender, currentPeriod, shares);
  }
```

### Impact

When bondTokens are held in external DeFi pools (e.g. Uniswap's bondETH/USDT pair), these pools become entitled to coupon distributions but have no mechanism to claim them. This creates two serious problems:

1. Coupons allocated for these pool-held tokens become permanently locked in the Distributor
2. More critically, during bear markets, auctions may consistently fail because the protocol calculates coupon requirements based on total bondToken supply (including DeFi pool holdings) rather than "claimable" supply.

### PoC

Consider the scenario of 80% of bondTokens are in DEX pools, auctions try to raise 5x more USDC than actually needed by *claimable holders*, likely failing in bear markets.

### Mitigation

### Mitigation

Implement a view function using `extcodesize` to dynamically detect if a bondholder is a smart contract (DEX pool) or use manual registry maintenance (I do not recommend manual registry since it's inconvenient). Modify auction calculations to exclude bond tokens held by contracts, ensuring only EOA-held tokens are considered for coupon distribution since they can claim.
