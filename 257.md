# Upgrade `__gaps` not present on upgradeable contracts

### Summary

Although most Protocol contracts follow an upgradeable pattern, only `Pool` provides gaps to upgradeability. This means, if at some point they need to add a local variable to attend to a specific demand, they can't do it.

### Root Cause

Lack of flexibility on upgrades. Only the `Pool`, by inheriting the OracleReader, has variable gaps.

### Mitigation

Even though you don't plan to add new variables, consider adding a `__gap[50]` to allow you to add it, if needed.
