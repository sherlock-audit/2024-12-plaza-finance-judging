# Insufficient Validation of Chainlink Price Feeds

### Summary

`OracleReader` is depended on for returning correct pricing data to the `Pool` contract when a user purchases bondETH or levETH -> and again when a user redeems bondETH or levETH for the reserve token, and then normalizes the amount for the specific decimals.

### Impact

However, `OracleReader` call to `AggregaatorV3Interface` does not employ the necessary validation checks for Chainlink Price Feeds to ensure the protocol is not receiving incorrect pricing data which would be an indication of the use of a faulty or deprecated data feed. 

`OracleReader` has a check for staleness using the heartbeat of the feed, but is missing a subsequent check that would ensure correct pricing data.

Without this check, `OracleReader` can return faulty pricing data that could significantly impact the amount of bondETH / levETH a user creates or redeems. Both of these can lead to significant losses for the protocol. 

In addition, the `heartBeat` will be hardcoded to 1 day in `OracleFeeds` if the price feed for the pair does not have a heartbeat. This can be way too long of a period for a staleness check, prices can significantly move within a day and having this as the staleness can be detrimental and essentially result in stale prices even if the staleness check passes.

### Mitigation

Add this check to ensure the pricing data is correct. In addition to the current staleness check.

```solidity
+   (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedTImestamp, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();

+   if(answer == 0) revert InvalidPrice();
```

If the feed pair does not have a designated heartbeat, consider a shorter time period for the hardcoded heartbeat.
