# Deployer contract uses BeaconProxy while BondToken implementation is UUPSUpgradeable

### Summary


The mismatch between the proxy type used in the `Deployer` contract (`BeaconProxy`) and the proxy type required by the `BondToken` implementation (`UUPSUpgradeable`) will result in the `BondToken` being non-functional, as the `UUPSUpgradeable` implementation requires specific functions (`_authorizeUpgrade`) that are not compatible with `BeaconProxy`. This will cause the deployed `BondToken` contracts to fail during initialization or upgrades, leading to a critical failure in the protocol's functionality.


### Root Cause

In the `Deployer` contract, the `deployBondToken` function (found [here](#code-snippet)) creates a `BeaconProxy` instance to deploy `BondToken`. However, the `BondToken` implementation is designed to function as a `UUPSUpgradeable` contract, which is incompatible with the `BeaconProxy` pattern. Specifically:

- **Deployer Contract (BeaconProxy):**
```solidity
  return address(new BeaconProxy(
    address(bondBeacon),
    abi.encodeCall(
      BondToken.initialize, (name, symbol, minter, governance, poolFactory, sharesPerToken)
    )
  ));
```

- **BondToken Contract (UUPSUpgradeable):**
```solidity
  contract BondToken is Initializable, ERC20Upgradeable, AccessControlUpgradeable, ERC20PermitUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable, PausableUpgradeable {  
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L18


The root cause is the use of a `BeaconProxy` in the `Deployer` contract to deploy a contract (`BondToken`) that requires a `UUPSUpgradeable` proxy. This design mistake causes an incompatibility in proxy logic.


### Internal Pre-conditions


1. The `Deployer` contract calls the `deployBondToken` function, passing the `bondBeacon` address and other parameters.
2. The `bondBeacon` address is used to create a `BeaconProxy` pointing to the `BondToken` implementation.
3. The `BondToken` implementation inherits from `UUPSUpgradeable`, which requires `_authorizeUpgrade` to perform upgrades.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The deployer deploys a `BondToken` using the `deployBondToken` function in the `Deployer` contract.
2. The deployed `BondToken` is backed by a `BeaconProxy`, which does not implement the `UUPSUpgradeable` logic required by the `BondToken` contract.
3. An attempt to initialize or upgrade the `BondToken` results in a failure since the required `_authorizeUpgrade` function is not called, breaking the contract's functionality.


### Impact

The protocol suffers a **critical failure** as the `BeaconProxy` is incompatible with the `UUPSUpgradeable` logic in the `BondToken` implementation. As a result:

1. The `BondToken` contracts are non-functional, rendering the protocol unusable.
2. Any attempt to upgrade `BondToken` contracts will fail, causing the protocol to lose upgradeability and flexibility.
3. Users and stakeholders of the protocol are severely impacted as the protocol cannot operate as intended.

### Mitigation

Replace the `BeaconProxy` in the `deployBondToken` function with a `UUPSUpgradeable` proxy
