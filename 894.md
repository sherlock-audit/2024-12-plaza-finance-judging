# removeExcessBids doesn't handle excess coupon values adequately

### Summary

The remove excess bids is a function utilized in removing excess coupon values with associated index if and whenever the currentCouponAmount is greater than the totalBuyCouponAmount. This is to ensure that the crucuial invariant that the currentCouponAmount doesn't exceed the  totalBuyCouponAmount is ensured. However this invariant is broken in scenarios whereby the current lowest bid index value is less than the total amount to remove.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L256-L276
The removeExcessBids function doesn't correctly handle removal of excess bid values when currentCouponAmount is greater than totalBuyCouponAmount. This scenario can manifest when a user attempts to make a bid with a substantially greater value with ensures that the totalBuyCouponAmount is crossed.  

The vulnerability lies in the first in the first block of removeExcessBids().   The function retrieves the value of  the lowest bid index and subtracts it from the amountToRemove, but doesn't capture instances where the value of the lowest bid is still not sufficient enough to  effect the requisite normalization on amountToRemove and concurrently on the currentCouponAmount.  The function goes ahead to call _removeBid(currentIndex) which only removes the lowest bid index and its value but doesn't appropriate currentCouponAmount to the normal value.
```solidity
function removeExcessBids() internal {
    if (currentCouponAmount <= totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      return;
    }

    uint256 amountToRemove = currentCouponAmount - totalBuyCouponAmount;
    uint256 currentIndex = lowestBidIndex;

    while (currentIndex != 0 && amountToRemove != 0) {
      // Cache the current bid's data into local variables
      Bid storage currentBid = bids[currentIndex];
      uint256 sellCouponAmount = currentBid.sellCouponAmount;
      uint256 prevIndex = currentBid.prevBidIndex;

      if (amountToRemove >= sellCouponAmount) {
        // Subtract the sellAmount from amountToRemove
        amountToRemove -= sellCouponAmount;

        // Remove the bid
        _removeBid(currentIndex);

        // Move to the previous bid (higher price)
        currentIndex = prevIndex;
      } else {
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

-The lowestBidIndex points to the lowest bid in the bids array.
-The latest coupon amount value is substantially higher than the lowestBidIndex value

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

-The function is called with currentCouponAmount greater than totalBuyCouponAmount.
-The function calculates amountToRemove as the difference between currentCouponAmount and totalBuyCouponAmount.
-The function iterates out the lowest bid index, removing its index and value from currentCouponAmount
-Even after removing bids, excess coupons remain in the contract, leading to breakage of major invariant.

### Impact

breaks invariant which says currentCouponAmount should not be higher than the totalBuyCouponAmount

### PoC

Consider the following example:

currentCouponAmount = 1000

totalBuyCouponAmount = 800

amountToRemove = 200

lowestBidIndex Value  = 100

     amountToRemove - lowestBidIndex Value = 100
    final  currentCouponAmount  = 900  //still greater than the totalBuyCouponAmount

The function iterates through the bids and aims to remove bids with a total sellCouponAmount of 200 to bring the currentCouponAmount to the max totalBuyCouponAmount of 800.   Due to the fact that the function only removes the lowest bid which might not have sufficient enough to normalize the currentCouponAmount,  the invariant is broken.




### Mitigation

This bug can be mitigated by using to approaches,  
i) By reverting the bid the coupon amount  to be added is greater than the totalBuyCouponAmount in bid()
```soliidty
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns(uint256) {
--    if (sellCouponAmount == 0 || sellCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount) revert InvalidSellAmount();
++  if (sellCouponAmount == 0 || sellCouponAmount +  currentCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0) revert InvalidSellAmount();
    if (buyReserveAmount == 0) revert BidAmountTooLow();
    if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh();

```

ii) Allow _removeBid() to set new lowestBidIndex after removing the previous and check if currentCouponAmount is greater  than totalBuyCouponAmount. If that is the case  removeExcessBids() should be called recurrently until all low bid values affected are removed.
