# Rounding bug can cause failed auction when it should be successful

### Summary

Plaza Finance uses an auction to sell `reserveToken` (e.g. wETH) for `couponToken` (e.g. USDC) to pay bondETH holders a yield each distribution period. When the auction starts, the protocol calculates `totalBuyCouponAmount`, which is the amount of couponTokens needed to pay bondETH holders for that period. Then the goal of the auction is to sell the lowest amount of `reserveToken` in exchange for the `totalBuyCouponAmount`.

When an auction participant calls `Auction::bid()`, the `Auction::removeExcessBids()` function is called:
```solidity
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external auctionActive whenNotPaused returns(uint256) {
...

    // Remove and refund out of range bids
@>  removeExcessBids();

...
  }

```

`removeExcessBids()`  checks to see if the bid offers a better price for the reserveToken. If it does AND the new bid + all existing bids coupon amount exceeds the total needed, the removeExcessBid() function will start at the lowest priced bid and check to see if it needs to remove the bid completely or only remove a portion of it. There's a rounding bug explained below using `@audit` tags:
```solidity
function removeExcessBids() internal {
...

      // Remove the entire bid
      if (amountToRemove >= sellCouponAmount) {
        amountToRemove -= sellCouponAmount;
        _removeBid(currentIndex);
        currentIndex = prevIndex;

      //  @audit Remove only a portion of the bid
      } else {
        // @audit proportion rounds down (e.g. 30.33333% rounds to 30%)
@>      uint256 proportion = (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount;
        currentBid.sellCouponAmount = sellCouponAmount - amountToRemove;
        currentCouponAmount -= amountToRemove;

        // @audit When buyReserveAmount is multiplied by proportion, the value is 
        // slightly smaller (e.g. 100 * 30% < 100 * 30.3333%)
@>      uint256 reserveReduction = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18);

        // @audit Now both the buyReserveAmount AND totalSellReserveAmount are slightly larger 
        // because reserveReduction is slightly smaller (e.g. 400 - 30.333 < 400 - 30)
@>      currentBid.buyReserveAmount = currentBid.buyReserveAmount - reserveReduction;
@>      totalSellReserveAmount -= reserveReduction;
       
...
      }
    }
  }

```

The issue this rounding causes is when `Auction::endAuction` is called.

There's a check that will set the `State` of the auction to `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` if the `totalSellReserveAmount` is larger than 90% (or whatever the poolSaleLimit is set to) of the reserveToken balance of the pool.
```solidity
function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
...

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
@>  } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

...
  }
```
There's an edge case where the `totalSellReserveAmount` is extremely close to `(IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100`. This rounding can make `totalSellReserveAmount` exceed the pool sale limit when it's actually less than it.

### Root Cause

In `Auction::removeExcessBids()`, `proportion` rounds down when it should round up.

### Attack Path

1. An auction starts seeking `totalBuyCouponAmount` of couponToken with a poolSaleLimit of 90%, capping how much reserveToken can be sold from the pool.
2. When a new, better-priced bid arrives increasing the total bid amount above the `totalBuyCouponAmount`, removeExcessBids() removes or trims lower-priced bids.
3. During partial removal, the function calculates a proportion, rounding down and subtracting less reserveToken than intended from each trimmed bid.
4. Because the partial removal doesn’t reduce quite enough reserveToken, small rounding discrepancies accumulate, causing totalSellReserveAmount to be slightly higher than it should be.
5. In `Auction::endAuction()`, if `totalSellReserveAmount` is at or above `poolBalance * poolSaleLimit`, the auction is labeled FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT.
6. The rounding error can push `totalSellReserveAmount` over this threshold—even if it should be below—leading to an auction failure when the auction was actually successful.

### Impact

An auction fails when it should have succeeded.

### Mitigation

Round proportion up.
