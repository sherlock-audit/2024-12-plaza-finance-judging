# [M-1] Auction architecture allows monopolization through unrestricted bidding, creating an unfair and toxic market

# **Description:** 
The lack of restrictions on bidding volume enables powerful actors to monopolize the auction process. This not only undermines the protocol's stated goal of fostering a vibrant and inclusive community but also actively discourages participation from smaller players.

Auction Contract:

# **Impact:** 
The documentation emphasizes Plaza's commitment to community well-being, including initiatives like the "Plaza Points Program." However, the current auction architecture directly contradicts this objective. By allowing whales to dominate the bidding process, the auction system effectively excludes the majority of the community, creating a toxic environment where smaller players are systematically outcompeted.

While the protocol may achieve its goal of consistent coupon acquisition, the unintended consequence is the transformation of the auction into a playground for whales, undermining its intended purpose as a fair and accessible exchange mechanism for the broader community. This not only discourages participation but also erodes trust in the protocol's commitment to inclusivity.

# **Proof of Concept:** 
Copy this test onto `Auction.t.sol`:

```javascript
  function testOneHugeBidReplacesAllOtherBids() public {
    // Create bidders
    uint256 initialBidAmount = 1000;
    uint256 initialSellAmount = 1000000000;

    // Create 1000 bids
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
      address newBidder = address(uint160(i + 1));
      vm.startPrank(newBidder);
      usdc.mint(newBidder, initialSellAmount);
      usdc.approve(address(auction), initialSellAmount);
      auction.bid(initialBidAmount, initialSellAmount);
      vm.stopPrank();
    }

    // Check initial state
    assertEq(auction.bidCount(), 1000, "bid count 1000");
    assertEq(auction.highestBidIndex(), 1, "highest bid index 1");
    assertEq(auction.lowestBidIndex(), 1000, "lowest bid index 1000");

    // Place a new high bid
    address highBidder = address(1001);
    uint256 highBidAmount = 1000 * 1000; // Buy all slots
    uint256 highSellAmount = 1000000000 * 1000; // Puts in the same amount of SellAmount, but for 1000 slots

    vm.startPrank(highBidder);
    usdc.mint(highBidder, highSellAmount);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), highSellAmount);
    auction.bid(highBidAmount, highSellAmount);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Check updated state
    assertEq(auction.bidCount(), 1, "bid count 1");
    assertEq(auction.highestBidIndex(), 1001, "highest bid index 1001");

    // Verify the new high bid
    (address highestBidder, uint256 highestBuyAmount, uint256 highestSellAmount,,,) = auction.bids(auction.highestBidIndex());
    assertEq(highestBidder, highBidder, "highest bidder");
    assertEq(highestBuyAmount, highBidAmount, "highest buy amount");
    assertEq(highestSellAmount, highSellAmount, "highest sell amount");
  }
```

This test is basically the same as `testMultipleBidsWithNewHighBid`, but with a massive bid that outbids every other slot.

By checking the updated state, it can be seen that it goes from 1000 to 1, leaving out all original 1000 bidders. This is intended functionality, but it is believed that it posses a monopoly problem.

# **Recommended Mitigation:**

To discourage whales from monopolizing slots and ensure fair participation, implement a non-refundable fee that increases exponentially as a bidder acquires more slots.

Mechanism:

- No fee is applied for an initial number of slots (e.g., the first 50 slots).
- A small fee is introduced after the initial threshold is exceeded.
- The fee increases significantly for each additional slot purchased beyond subsequent thresholds (e.g., every 50 slots thereafter). This effectively discourages excessive slot purchases by making them increasingly expensive.

Benefits:

- **Fairer Distribution:** Prevents a single entity from dominating the auction, increasing opportunities for smaller bidders. Even if whales attempt to circumvent this by creating multiple accounts, the perception of a less concentrated market can psychologically encourage smaller bidders to participate more actively, believing they have a fairer chance of success.
- **Protocol Revenue:** Generates additional revenue for the protocol through the non-refundable fees.
- **Deterrence:** Discourages whales from making speculative bids, as the potential losses from excessive purchases increase.

Considerations:

- **Fee Percentage:** Carefully determine the appropriate fee percentage to balance fairness for smaller bidders and revenue generation for the protocol (consider making this a governance variable).
- **Minimum Bidders:** Define a target number of active bidders to ensure sufficient competition and a healthy market (e.g., minimum 20 bidders).
- **Whale Mitigation:** While this mechanism discourages extreme concentration, it doesn't completely prevent it. However, it creates a more level playing field, fostering a more inclusive and competitive auction environment.

_Note:_ This mitigation should be carefully evaluated and tested to ensure it achieves the desired outcome without creating unintended consequences.
