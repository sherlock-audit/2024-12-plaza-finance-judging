# Potential DOS and Precision Loss in getIndexedUserAmount Due to Unbounded Loop and Balance Multiplication

### Summary

The [`getIndexedUserAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L194) function has two significant issues:
1. An unbounded loop that could cause DOS if too many periods pass without user updates
2.A precision loss/overflow risk because it repeatedly applies period calculations to the full balance instead of period-specific balances


### Root Cause

The function uses a loop that iterates through all periods between the user's last update and current period. It also applies the full balance to each period calculation instead of considering period-specific balances.
```javascript
for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
    shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
}
```
Problems:
1. If period - userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod becomes large, the function could exceed gas limits
2. Using the same balance for each period calculation is incorrect because it assumes the user held this balance for all past periods

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Potential DOS: Users who haven't updated their assets for many periods could have their transactions revert
2. Using full current balance for historical periods leads to inflated share calculations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add a mechanism for Force periodic updates
