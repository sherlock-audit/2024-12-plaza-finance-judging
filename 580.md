# Plaza Finance Fails to Check Sequencer Downtime When Using Chainlink Oracles on Base

### Summary

Plaza Finance intends to deploy its protocol on the Base. The protocol uses Chainlink price feeds to determine the value of underlying assets, which is crucial for calculating how much `bondETH` or `levETH` to create or redeem for users.  

When deploying on an L2, Chainlink strongly recommends checking the status of the sequencer to ensure the validity of the price data. If the sequencer is down, the price feeds may become outdated or inaccurate, leading to incorrect price calculations. This poses a risk of financial harm to users and the protocol.  

For more details, see the official documentation: [Chainlink L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds).  

### Root Cause

In  [`OracleReader.sol::55-76`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L55-L76) `getOraclePrice` function does not include a check to ensure that the sequencer is operational when fetching prices from Chainlink oracles. Without this validation, the protocol risks using stale or invalid prices during sequencer downtime.  

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

The sequencer on Base goes offline

### Attack Path

1. The sequencer on Base goes offline due to maintenance, downtime, or other issues.  
2. Chainlink oracles continue to return prices based on outdated data.  
3. The protocol uses these stale prices to calculate how much `bondETH` or `levETH` to mint or redeem for users.  
4. This results in:  
   - Users receiving incorrect amounts of `bondETH` or `levETH`.  
   - Financial discrepancies in the protocol, leading to losses.  

### Impact

- **User Impact:** Users could lose funds or receive incorrect amounts of `bondETH` or `levETH` due to stale price data.  
- **Protocol Impact:** Plaza Finance may face financial losses and inconsistencies in its internal calculations. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, the `getOraclePrice` function should check the status of the sequencer feed before using price data. The function should change to something like this for more detailed information please refer to the official Chainlink [documentation]( https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds.)

```solidity  
function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns (uint256) {  
     (
            /*uint80 roundID*/,
            int256 answer,
            uint256 startedAt,
            /*uint256 updatedAt*/,
            /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
        ) = sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData();

        // Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
        // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }

        ...
        (, int256 answer,, uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();

        if (updatedTimestamp + OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).feedHeartbeats(feed) < block.timestamp) {
            revert StalePrice();
        }
        ...
}  
```
