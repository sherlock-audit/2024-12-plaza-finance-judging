# Inefficient input validation in `PreDeposit.setBondAndLeverageAmount()`  could lead to a DOS in `createPool()`

### Summary

The missing check in `setBondAndLeverageAmount()` could DOS the `createPool()` function if the Bond and Leverage amount were set to 0.
```solidity
  function setBondAndLeverageAmount(uint256 _bondAmount, uint256 _leverageAmount) external onlyOwner checkDepositNotEnded {
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();

    bondAmount = _bondAmount;
    leverageAmount = _leverageAmount;
  }
```

### Root Cause

in the `PreDeposit.sol` there is a missing check for 0 amount in `setBondAndLeverageAmount()` function,
could DOS the `createPool()`:
```solidity
  function createPool() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (reserveAmount == 0) revert NoReserveAmount();
    if (bondAmount == 0 || leverageAmount == 0) revert InvalidBondOrLeverageAmount();
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
    IERC20(params.reserveToken).approve(address(factory), reserveAmount);
    pool = factory.createPool(params, reserveAmount, bondAmount, leverageAmount, bondName, bondSymbol, leverageName, leverageSymbol, true);

    emit PoolCreated(pool);
    poolCreated = true;
  }
```
if one of these two values were set to 0 and the deposit time ended, `createPool()` will revert in the third line:

### Internal Pre-conditions

`leverageAmount ` or `bondAmount` equal to zero.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `leverageAmount ` or `bondAmount` were equal to zero.
2. deposit time passed.
3. no way to set `leverageAmount ` and `bondAmount` via `setBondAndLeverageAmount()` because of this modifier `checkDepositNotEnded()`
```solidity
  modifier checkDepositNotEnded() {
    if (block.timestamp >= depositEndTime) revert DepositEnded();
    _;
  }
```

### Impact

`createPool()` will be DOSed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

i would recommand to remove the `checkDepositNotEnded()` modifier since `setBondAndLeverageAmount()` is an onlyOwner function and the owner is trusted. 
and add the following check to `setBondAndLeverageAmount()`:
```solidity
  function setBondAndLeverageAmount(uint256 _bondAmount, uint256 _leverageAmount) external onlyOwner checkDepositNotEnded {
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
    if (_bondAmount == 0 || _leverageAmount == 0) revert BondAndLeverageShouldNotBeZero();

    bondAmount = _bondAmount;
    leverageAmount = _leverageAmount;
  }
```
