# Loss of Coupon Shares from Previous Periods During Claim

### Summary

claim() function allows users to claim shares based on their bond token balance and coupon distribution for the current period. However, when a user claims their shares, their indexed user assets are reset, resulting in the loss of shares accumulated over previous periods. This issue is compounded when a user mints additional bond tokens before claiming their rewards, as this action resets their indexed period and forfeits any previous rewards.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in how the system updates user assets during interactions:

Reset Indexed Period on Claim: The resetIndexedUserAssets function is called during the claim() process, which sets the indexed assets to the current period. This behavior removes historical tracking for previous periods.
Last Updated Period Reset: The getIndexedUserAmount function relies on lastUpdatedPeriod to calculate shares. If a user mints new tokens, the system updates this period, ignoring prior unclaimed rewards.
```solidity 
 function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }


bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);


```

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path
User deposits assets to mint 1,000 bond tokens at period 1.
User holds the tokens for four distribution periods, accruing rewards for periods 1–4.
At period 5, the user mints 500 additional tokens.
The indexed period resets to period 5, forfeiting rewards from periods 1–4.
When claiming, the user receives only rewards for period 5 onward, losing rewards for the earlier periods.
### Impact

loss of previous shares allocated over period.

### Mitigation

Modify the system so that minting or depositing new bond tokens does not reset the indexed period for previous bond holdings. This would ensure that users continue to accumulate rewards for prior periods even after additional deposits.
