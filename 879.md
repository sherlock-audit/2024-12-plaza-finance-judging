# `Distributor.sol::claim()` also calculates the shares for cancelled auction.

### Summary

when claiming the distribution token it is also calculating for cancelled auctions resulting in wrong calcuation of shares that need to distributed to users.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L88

```javascript
    function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
@>        uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod).normalizeAmount(
            bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals()
        );
    }
```

`BondToken.sol::getIndexedUserAmount()`:-

```javascript
    function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns (uint256) {
        IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
        uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

@>      for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
@>          shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
        }

        return shares;
    }
```

When a auction is created it sets the `sharesPerToken` but when it is cancelled is not set to 0. This results in wrong calcuation for claim shares as it is also calculating for the shares of cancelled auctions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Auction get cancelled and a new auction is created.

### External Pre-conditions

New bidder bids with higher `sellCouponAmount` and `reserveAmount` but the price ie (`reserveAmount:sellCouponAmount`) is same as other bid.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users who claim first will get more shares and users who calls claim will be reverted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When the auctions get cancelled sets the sharesPerToken to 0 of that particular period.
