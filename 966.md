# Distribute function can be called even if the auction has not been finished

### Summary

The `Pool.distribute()` function doesn't revert, if the auction state is BIDDING. Hence, the coupon funds can be distributed right after the auction has started, without receiving them from the sale on auction. The auction then can finish in failed state, not providing missed coupon funds. This leads to loss of funds by the protocol.

### Root Cause

In `Pool.distribute()` function there is no check, that the auction state is SUCCEEDED. That's why it can be called right after the auction start
