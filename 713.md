# Insufficient auction state validation will cause incorrect coupon distribution for bond holders as protocol allows premature allocation

### Summary

**The absence of auction success verification in `Pool.distribute()` will cause improper coupon payouts for bond holders as the protocol distributes coupons before auction resolution.** The missing state check allows distribution using preliminary auction data while coupon tokens remain uncommitted, leading to premature claims that should be rolled over on auction failure.

### Root Cause

In [Pool.sol#L589-614](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589-L614) the distribution mechanism retrieves `totalBuyCouponAmount` without confirming auction completion. This allows two failure modes:
1. **Premature Claims**: If Pool holds external coupon tokens, distribution succeeds using unvalidated auction amounts
2. **State Mismatch**: Uses initial auction parameters that may change during bidding phase

```solidity
  function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());

    // Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
@>  uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();

@>  if (Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT ||
@>      Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD) {
      emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
      return;
    }

    // Get Distributor
    address distributor = poolFactory.distributors(address(this));

    // Transfer coupon tokens to the distributor
@>  IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(distributor, couponAmountToDistribute);

    // Update distributor with the amount to distribute
@>  Distributor(distributor).allocate(couponAmountToDistribute);

    emit Distributed(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute, distributor);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Pool contract must hold coupon tokens (either from previous distributions or external sources)
2. Auction for target period must be in BIDDING state when distribute() is called


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Admin seeds Pool** with coupon tokens through fee mechanisms or direct transfers
2. **Auction starts** but remains in BIDDING state past distribution period
3. **User calls distribute()** referencing unfinished auction's totalBuyCouponAmount
4. **Protocol transfers Pool-held coupons** to Distributor using unvalidated amount
5. **Bond holders claim coupons** before auction resolution
6. **Auction later fails** but coupons remain distributed instead of rolling over


### Impact

**Protocol suffers permanent accounting errors** - bond holders receive coupon payments that should have been retained for future distributions when auctions fail. This creates protocol insolvency risk and breaks the core rollover mechanic.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
// In Pool.distribute()
require(
    Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.SUCCEEDED,
    "Distribution requires successful auction"
);
```
