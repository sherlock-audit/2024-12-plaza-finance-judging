# User is minted twice as much tokens when using `preDeposit` contract

## Summary

User will get twice as much tokens when using `preDeposit` contract.

## Bug description
`preDeposit` contract serves as a temporary contract that users can deposit assets into ahead of the protocol launch. When the main protocol launches, assets are rolled over into the Pool and users receives bondETH and levETH. The problem is that users receive *both* tokens, even though they deposit an amount backing only one of them.


When using Pool's `create()` function user specifies a token type to mint, however the preDeposit contract mints both tokens, where amount for each token was determined using the same `userBalance` variable.

[PreDeposit.sol#L172-L182](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L172-L182)

```solidity
uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
uint256 userLeverageShare = (leverageAmount * userBalance) /
    reserveAmount;
balances[msg.sender] = 0;
if (userBondShare > 0) {
    IERC20(bondToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, userBondShare);
}
if (userLeverageShare > 0) {
    IERC20(leverageToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, userLeverageShare);
}
```

This essentially creates a 2X leverage, where X amount of reserve token backs both K and Y amount of bondETH and levETH respectively. Contrary to the approach used in the Pool contract where X amount of reserve tokens back either K or Y amount of bondETH or levETH respectively.

This leads to a problem where users depositing in the `preDeposit` contract can redeem their bondETH and levETH for twice as much assets deposited. Consider a scenario where the Pool starts with the collateral rate lesser than the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, so the `redeemRate` of both tokens is calculated as `(tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply`, thus making bondETH be eligible for 80% of the tvl and levETH be eligible for 20% of the TVL. The TVL of the Pool is X, so naturally if user redeems his K and Y amount of bondETH and levETH, he will only receive X amount of tokens he deposited back. However, if new user deposits their assets minting themselves only one of two tokens, the depositor of the preDeposit contract will be able to steal part of new user's deposit.


## Root cause
`PreDeposit` contract mints both bondETH and levETH to the user, even though user deposited an amount backing only one token.

## Attack path
1. User deposits assets into the `PreDeposit` contract and gets minted both bondETH and levETH.
2. The main protocol launches and user wait for new users to deposit assets into the pool.
3. New assets enter the pool and user redeems his bondETH and levETH stealing part of the other user's deposits.

## Impact
User can steal part of the assets deposited in the Pool.

## Recommended Mitigation
Allow users to specify which token they wish to receive when using `preDeposit` contract similarly to the way `create()` function of the Pool contract works, or when calculating the amount of tokens to mint in `preDeposit` contract divide userBalance by 2, so the amount of bondETH and levETH to receive is split.
