# Market Rate Calculation Error in LEVERAGE Token Redemption

### Summary

A coding error in the `_redeem` function causes incorrect `redeemRate` calculation for LEVERAGE token redemptions when `marketRate` is lower than the calculated `redeemRate`. This issue leads to inaccurate token exchanges, which negatively impacts the protocol and its users.

### Root Cause


In the `_redeem` function, the `redeemRate` is recalculated based on `marketRate` for both BOND and LEVERAGE token types. Specifically, the conditional logic:

```solidity
if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
    redeemRate = marketRate;
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L519-L521

unintentionally uses `marketRate` derived for [BOND](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L446-L450) tokens without differentiation when the token type is LEVERAGE. This results in an inaccurate `redeemRate` for LEVERAGE tokens.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user invokes the `redeem` function with `tokenType` set to `LEVERAGE`.
2. The `marketRate` is derived from a BOND token oracle feed.
3. The calculated `redeemRate` for LEVERAGE tokens is higher than `marketRate`.


### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


1. A user calls the `redeem` function with `tokenType` set to `LEVERAGE` and a valid `depositAmount`.
2. The system calculates `marketRate` based on the BOND token oracle feed.
3. The `redeemRate` for LEVERAGE tokens is overwritten with the incorrect `marketRate` derived for BOND tokens.
4. The user receives an inaccurate amount of reserve tokens for their LEVERAGE token redemption.

### Impact

The affected party (users redeeming LEVERAGE tokens) suffers inaccurate token exchanges. This can result in economic loss to users due to undervaluation of their LEVERAGE tokens.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address this issue, ensure that `marketRate` is calculated distinctly for each token type. Modify the conditional logic to check the token type before applying `marketRate`. For example:

```solidity
if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND && marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
    redeemRate = marketRate;
}
```
