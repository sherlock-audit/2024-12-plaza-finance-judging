# Vulnerability Allowing Attacker to Take Over Lowest Bid Slot in Auction Contract

### Summary

A vulnerability in the [`Auction::bid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125) function allows an attacker to replace the lowest bidder's position with their own bid under specific conditions. By crafting a bid that matches the price of the lowest bid but has a higher `sellCouponAmount`, the attacker can exploit the system to take over the lowest bid slot. This manipulation results in the original bidder losing their position unfairly, while the attacker retains the spot at no additional cost.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the logic handling bids when `bidCount` equals `maxBids`. The contract does not properly validate that new bids with the same price as the lowest bid cannot replace existing bids. Additionally, the `removeExcessBids` function allows the attacker to decrease coupon amount of their bid to the original lowest bid value while retaining control of the slot.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `bidCount` must be equal to `maxBids`.  
2. The lowest bid slot must have only one bid.  
3. The attacker must calculate a new bid with the same price as the lowest bid but with a higher `sellCouponAmount`. 

### Attack Path

1. The attacker identifies the lowest bid and calculates a new bid that satisfies the condition:  
   `newSellCouponAmount * lowestBidderBuyReserveAmount == lowestBidderSellCouponAmount * newBuyReserveAmount`.  
2. The attacker submits the crafted bid with a higher `sellCouponAmount` using the `Auction::bid` function.  
3. The new bid is accepted, increasing `bidCount` beyond `maxBids`.
4. The lowest bid is removed by calling [`_removeBid(lowestBidIndex)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L157).
5. The [`removeExcessBids`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L161) function is called, which removes the excess part of the attacker's bid, reducing it to the original lowest bid value.  
6. The attacker now holds the lowest bid slot with their address, displacing the original bidder.  

### Impact

This vulnerability undermines the fairness and integrity of the auction process. Legitimate bidders can lose their positions to attackers without any additional cost to the attacker.

### PoC

Consider a scenario where the number of bids equals `maxBids`. The lowest bid has the following values:  
- `buyReserveAmount = 1`  
- `sellCouponAmount = 1`  

The second lowest bid has a price greater than 1 (`price = sellCouponAmount / buyReserveAmount`).  

An attacker calls the `Auction::bid` function with:  
- `buyReserveAmount = 2`  
- `sellCouponAmount = 2`  

Due to the condition:  
```solidity
function insertSortedBid(uint256 newBidIndex) internal {
	Bid storage newBid = bids[newBidIndex];
	uint256 newSellCouponAmount = newBid.sellCouponAmount;
	uint256 newBuyReserveAmount = newBid.buyReserveAmount;
	...

	if (highestBidIndex == 0) {
	  ...
	} else {
	  uint256 currentBidIndex = highestBidIndex;
	  uint256 previousBidIndex = 0;

	  // Traverse the linked list to find the correct spot for the new bid
	  while (currentBidIndex != 0) {
		...
		leftSide = newSellCouponAmount * currentBuyReserveAmount;
                rightSide = currentSellCouponAmount * newBuyReserveAmount;
		
@>		if (leftSide > rightSide || (leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount > currentSellCouponAmount)) {
		  break;
		}
		...
}
```
the new bid is inserted as the second lowest bid (a bid with the same price but a higher `sellCouponAmount` is prioritized over a bid with a lower `sellCouponAmount`). 

Since `bidCount` now exceeds `maxBids`, the lowest bid is removed via `_removeBid(lowestBidIndex)`. Next, the `removeExcessBids()` function is called, reducing the attackerâ€™s bid to:  
- `buyReserveAmount = 1`  
- `sellCouponAmount = 1`  

This adjustment returns 1 coupon token to the attacker. As a result, the attacker takes over the lowest bid slot with the same bid values as the original bidder.  

### Mitigation

To prevent this exploit, consider the following approaches:  

1. **Order by Bid Timestamp:**  
   Change the logic to ensure bids with the same effective price are ordered based on who placed the bid first.  

   Example implementation:  
```diff
function insertSortedBid(uint256 newBidIndex) internal {
	Bid storage newBid = bids[newBidIndex];
	uint256 newSellCouponAmount = newBid.sellCouponAmount;
	uint256 newBuyReserveAmount = newBid.buyReserveAmount;
	...

	if (highestBidIndex == 0) {
	  ...
	} else {
	  uint256 currentBidIndex = highestBidIndex;
	  uint256 previousBidIndex = 0;

	  // Traverse the linked list to find the correct spot for the new bid
	  while (currentBidIndex != 0) {
		...
		leftSide = newSellCouponAmount * currentBuyReserveAmount;
                rightSide = currentSellCouponAmount * newBuyReserveAmount;
		
-	        if (leftSide > rightSide || (leftSide == rightSide && newSellCouponAmount > currentSellCouponAmount)) {
+               if (leftSide > rightSide) {
		  break;
		}
		...
}
```

2. **Additional Bid Validation:**  
   Implement a check to ensure that a new bid cannot result in the same `buyReserveAmount` and `sellCouponAmount` as the removed lowest bid.
