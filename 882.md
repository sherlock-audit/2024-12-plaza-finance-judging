# Incorrect fee calculation when claiming the owed fee.

### Summary

When claiming the performance fee of the Pool, int the formula incorrectly is assumes that the balance has been the same through the whole period for which it is claimed. This will lead to a loss for the users and gain for the protocol, or loss for the protocol and gain for the users.

### Root Cause

The fee in the protocol should be fee for assets under management. Every time a user creates or redeems tokens, the current fee under management is calculated and deducted from the pool's balance ([ref](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273) and [ref](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433)), to ensure correct price calculation. However this fee is not recorded anywhere.
So when [claimFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L700) is called, the fee is recalculated. However, the formula used ([ref](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L719)) is linear - the current pool balance in constant, the fee is constant, the seconds per yer are constant and the only variable is the time. But this design choice is a mistake, because the balance of the pool is not the same through the whole period for which we are charging.

### Attack Path

1. Users create tokens and increase the current balance.
2. After some time, users redeem tokens and reduce the current balance.
3. Repeat 1. and 2.
4. Claim the balance

### Impact

The protocol will collect inaccurate fee, which might result in loss for the protocol itself (collect less then it should) or the pool(collected more than it should).

### PoC

### Mitigation

Instead of calculating the fee linear, calculate the fee for assets under management upon every change of the pool's balance and save it in another state variable. This way when claiming the precise amount will be withdrawn from the pool.
