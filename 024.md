# Unhandled Reverts in getOraclePrice will lead to DoS

### Summary

The ``getOraclePrice()`` function in ``src/OracleReader.sol`` is designed to retrieve the latest price for a token pair from an oracle. However, it reverts in the following scenarios:

  -   Missing Price Feed: If no price feed exists for the provided token pair (quote and base), the function reverts with NoFeedFound.
   - Stale Price Data: If the price data is older than the configured heartbeat, the function reverts with StalePrice.

When ``getOraclePrice()`` is used in other functions, such as ``latestRoundData()`` in ``src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol``, its reversion can disrupt the entire workflow. Specifically, ``latestRoundData()`` iterates over multiple tokens in a Balancer pool and calls ``getOraclePrice()`` for each token. If ``getOraclePrice()`` reverts for even one token, the entire transaction fails.

### Root Cause

The ``getOraclePrice()`` function reverts when:

- No Price Feed Found: If no valid price feed exists for a given token pair (quote and base), the function reverts with NoFeedFound.
- Stale Price Data: If the price data for a feed is older than the configured heartbeat, the function reverts with StalePrice.

When ``getOraclePrice()`` is used in functions such as ``latestRoundData()``, these reverts are not handled gracefully. As a result:
- A single failure (e.g., invalid or unsupported token, stale feed) disrupts the entire workflow.
- The transaction reverts, leading to a denial of service for all tokens in the pool.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1/ The getOraclePrice function is called within the latestRoundData function.
2/ The tokens array in latestRoundData contains at least one token address (tokens[i]) that:
- Has no corresponding price feed in the oracle contract.
- Points to a stale price feed (last updated beyond the allowed heartbeat).

3/ The loop in latestRoundData attempts to retrieve prices for all tokens using ``getOraclePrice()``.

### External Pre-conditions

1/ The oracleFeeds contract used by ``getOraclePrice()``,
 - Does not have a valid price feed for the given token pair (quote and base). 
- Has a heartbeat configuration that marks the price as stale.

2/ The function caller invokes ``latestRoundData()``, expecting it to process all tokens in the pool successfully.
Inputs to the function (tokens[i]) might be incorrect, such as:

   - address(0) as one of the token inputs.
   - An unsupported or invalid token.

### Attack Path

1/ Denial of Service:

- An attacker includes a token address in the tokens array for which there is no valid price feed in the oracle contract or forces the use of a stale feed.
- When latestRoundData calls getOraclePrice for this token, the function reverts with NoFeedFound or StalePrice.
- The entire transaction fails, disrupting workflows relying on latestRoundData.

2/ Exploitation of Missing Validation:
- Malicious input, such as address(0) for quote or base, can bypass validation in ``getOraclePrice()``, causing the function to revert.

3/ Supply Chain Exploit:
- If the oracle contract's heartbeat configuration is modified or if feeds are intentionally not updated, it can cause ``getOraclePrice()`` to revert consistently for specific tokens.

### Impact

A single failure in ``getOraclePrice()`` causes the calling function (e.g., latestRoundData) to revert entirely, even if other tokens have valid price feeds.
This can lead to:

   - Denial of Service: A single problematic token disrupts functionality for all tokens in the pool.
   - Reduced Usability: Users and external systems relying on ``latestRoundData()`` cannot recover gracefully from these failures.
