# Lack of Support for wstETH/USD Price Feed in BalancerOracleAdapter Prevents Initial Deployment with wstETH

### Summary

The project team intends to use **wstETH** as the initial underlying asset for the Pool. However, the design of the protocol relies on price feeds in the format `asset/USD` for calculating pool prices, and there is no `wstETH/USD` price feed available on the Base network. Consequently, any transaction involving wstETH as an underlying asset will revert, rendering the initial deployment objective infeasible with the current code design.

While the team has expressed intentions to implement adapters for cases where `asset/USD` price feeds are unavailable, this functionality has not been implemented, leaving the protocol unable to support its intended use case during the audit.

This issue was identified during the Sherlock audit and highlights a significant gap between the project’s stated goals and the current readiness of its codebase.

### Root Cause

The `BalancerOracleAdapter` contract and its dependency, `OracleReader`, rely exclusively on `asset/USD` price feeds to compute fair pool prices. When querying for a price feed:

1. The `getOraclePrice` function in `OracleReader` checks for a direct price feed between the provided quote and base assets.
2. If no such feed exists, it attempts to find an inverted feed (e.g., `USD/asset`) and calculates the price accordingly.
3. In the absence of both direct and inverted feeds, the function reverts with a `NoFeedFound` error.

Since NO `wstETH/USD` price feed exists on Base, any operation involving wstETH as the pool’s underlying asset will fail.

Additionally, the project has not implemented a mechanism to integrate custom adapters to handle cases where `asset/USD` feeds are unavailable, despite plans to do so.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The project has not implemented a mechanism to integrate custom adapters to handle cases where `asset/USD` feeds are unavailable

### External Pre-conditions

The absence of wstETH/USD or USD/wstETH price feed on Base

### Attack Path

1. The project deploys its protocol with wstETH as the underlying asset.
2. A user attempts to interact with the protocol (e.g., adding liquidity).
3. The protocol attempts to retrieve the `wstETH/USD` price.
4. Since no such price feed exists, the [`getOraclePrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L55-L76) function in `OracleReader` reverts, halting the transaction.
5. As a result, the protocol becomes non-functional for its intended use case.

### Impact

- **Protocol Impact:** The protocol cannot operate with wstETH as the underlying asset, directly contradicting the team’s stated deployment objectives.
- **User Impact:** Users are unable to interact with the protocol as intended, leading to frustration and loss of confidence in the project.
- **Development Timeline Impact:** The team must implement significant changes to support adapters or alternative mechanisms for price computation, delaying the project’s launch.

### PoC

1. As you can see there is no wstETH/USD or USD/wstETH price feed on Base: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=base&page=1&search=wstETH

2. The codebase clearly indicates it is not prepared to support assets without a USD price feed. Despite the protocol team's intent to use adapters for such cases, these adapters are absent during the audit, while the intent to use wstETH is explicitly stated.

### Mitigation

To address this issue, one of the following actions are recommended:

1. **Implement the Needed Adapter:**  
   Develop and integrate adapters to derive `wstETH/USD` prices using available price feeds (e.g., `wstETH/ETH` and `ETH/USD`).

or
 
2. **Update Communication:**  
   Avoid stating that the protocol supports wstETH until the necessary mechanisms are implemented, then update the messaging accordingly.
