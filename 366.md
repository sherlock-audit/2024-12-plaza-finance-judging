# Pool::create Deadline Can Be Bypassed

### Summary

The `Pool` contract manages a pool of assets, allowing for the creation and redemption of bond and leverage tokens. It also handles distribution periods and interacts with an oracle for price information.

### Root Cause

The `deadline` parameter is an arbitrary value chosen by the caller.

`Pool::create` implements a `deadline` timestamp (in seconds) for executing the transaction. However, without any on-chain signature verification or allowance mechanism, and given that deadline is an arbitrary value set by the caller, it serves no functional purpose.
