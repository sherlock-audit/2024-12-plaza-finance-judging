# Inaccurate Share Calculations Due to Inclusion of Failed Auctions

### Summary

The main problem is that when `startAuction` is called, it triggers `increaseIndexedAssetPeriod`, which increments `globalPool.currentPeriod` by one. Since not every auction is completed—some may fail—the `Distributor:claim` function, when calculating the user's share, does not ignore failed auctions and passes `currentPeriod` for calculation, which includes the failed auctions as well. As a result, failed auctions are included in the share calculation, leading to incorrect share calculations.


### Root Cause

When an auction starts, it [increments](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L567) `globalPool.currentPeriod` by one in the [increaseIndexedAssetPeriod](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L225) function of bondToken  contract.


So, in the [auction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336C1-L350C4) contract, when the auction ends, it transitions to one of three states: `FAILED_UNDERSOLD`, `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`, or `SUCCEEDED`. If the state is `SUCCEEDED`, it calls the [transferReserveToAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L577-L583) function of the pool to receive the `totalSellReserveAmount` and transfers the `buyCouponToken` to the pool contract. However, if the state is one of the other two, we do not call the `transferReserveToAuction` function or send `buyCouponToken` tokens to the pool. So, in the pool's [distribute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589-L614) function, if the auction state is `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` or `FAILED_UNDERSOLD`, we return because the auction has failed.

```solidity
 function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    //...
    if (Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT ||
        Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD) {

      emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
      return;
    }
    //..
```


In the [Distributor::claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L78-L111) function, when we calculate the shares for the users, the user's share is determined through the bondToken's `getIndexedUserAmount` function. We pass the `currentPeriod`, and based on that period and the user's balance, the `getIndexedUserAmount` function returns the share the user is entitled to.


The problem here is that, as mentioned above, not all auctions succeed. We pass the `currentPeriod` to the `BondToken.sol:getIndexedUserAmount` function, and the `currentPeriod` is also incremented by failed auctions. As a result, failed auctions are included in the share calculation logic, causing an over-allocation of rewards to users. The `BondToken.getIndexedUserAmount` function calculates shares for all periods, including those with failed auctions, leading to a mismatch between the actual reward pool and the calculated user shares.

```solidity
  function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    BondToken bondToken = Pool(pool).bondToken();
    address couponToken = Pool(pool).couponToken();

    if (address(bondToken) == address(0) || couponToken == address(0)){
      revert UnsupportedPool();
    }

    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
    //... 
```

### Impact

The share calculation is incorrect because it includes failed auctions, leading to inaccurate reward distribution.


### PoC


1. The total supply of `BondToken` is **100e18**.
2. Each successful auction generates **250e6 USDC** tokens for distribution because sharePerToken = 2.5e6 
3. A user, Alice, holds **10e18** `BondToken`, representing **10%** of the total supply.


1. **Auction 1 - Successful**:
   - The auction starts, and `globalPool.currentPeriod++` increments the `currentPeriod` to `1`.
   - The auction succeeds and transfers **250e6 USDC** to the `Distributor` contract for distribution.
   - Alice claims her share:
     - Alice receives **25e6 USDC**, and her indexed assets are reset using `resetIndexedUserAssets` in bondToken.

2. **Auction 2 - Failed**:
   - A new auction starts, and `globalPool.currentPeriod++` increments the `currentPeriod` to `2`.
   - The auction fails and does not transfer any USDC tokens to the `Distributor`.
   - Alice calls the `claim` function:
     - The `claim` calculation includes the failed auction (period `2`) because the `currentPeriod` is incremented regardless of auction success or failure.
     - Since no rewards were distributed for auction `2`, this function may revert it NotEnoughSharesToDistribute()

3. **Auction 3 - Successful**:
   - Another auction starts, and `globalPool.currentPeriod++` increments the `currentPeriod` to `3`.
   - The auction succeeds, transferring **250e6 USDC** to the `Distributor`.
   - Alice calls the `claim` function again:
     - Her share is now double-counted due to the failed auction (`2`) being included in the period calculation:
     - Alice incorrectly claims **50e6 USDC**, with **25e6 USDC** coming from the failed auction period.



### Mitigation



1. **Tracking Successful Periods**:
   - Introduce a mapping, e.g., `mapping(uint256 => bool) public isSuccessfulPeriod`, to track whether a given period corresponds to a successful auction.
   - Update this mapping only when an auction succeeds.

2. **Modify `claim` Logic**:
   - Adjust the `claim` function to calculate user shares based only on successful periods:
```solidity
     function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
         BondToken bondToken = Pool(pool).bondToken();
         address couponToken = Pool(pool).couponToken();

         if (address(bondToken) == address(0) || couponToken == address(0)) {
             revert UnsupportedPool();
         }

         (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
         uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
         uint256 totalShares = 0;

         for (uint256 period = 1; period <= currentPeriod; period++) {
             if (isSuccessfulPeriod[period]) {
                 uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, period)
                     .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
                 totalShares += shares;
             }
         }

         if (IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < totalShares) {
             revert NotEnoughSharesBalance();
         }

         couponAmountToDistribute -= totalShares;
         bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
         IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalShares);
         emit ClaimedShares(msg.sender, currentPeriod, totalShares);
     }
```
