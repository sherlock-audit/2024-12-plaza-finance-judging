# Static bondAmount and leverageAmount in PreDeposit Can Cause Imbalanced Reserve to Token Ratios

### Summary

In the PreDeposit contract, bondAmount and leverageAmount are set manually by the admin without accounting for dynamic changes in user deposits. If users withdraw their funds after the admin sets these values but before the pool is created, the resulting ratio of reserve tokens to bond/leverage tokens may deviate from the intended allocation, causing unintended pool dynamics.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L136

`PreDeposit:withdraw()`:-

```javascript
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
        if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        reserveAmount -= amount;

        IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);

        emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

```javascript
    function setBondAndLeverageAmount(uint256 _bondAmount, uint256 _leverageAmount)
        external
        onlyOwner
        checkDepositNotEnded
    {
        if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();

        bondAmount = _bondAmount;
        leverageAmount = _leverageAmount;
    }
```

The bondAmount and leverageAmount parameters are manually configured by the admin via the setBondAndLeverageAmount() function. These values remain static and do not adjust based on the total reserveAmount. Users can withdraw their deposits after these values are set, altering the reserve amount and causing a mismatch in the final reserve-to-token ratio when the pool is created.

### Internal Pre-conditions

	1.	Admins set the bondAmount and leverageAmount using setBondAndLeverageAmount().
	2.	Users have deposited enough tokens to reach the reserveCap.

### External Pre-conditions

1.	Users withdraw a significant portion of their deposits after the admin sets the bondAmount and leverageAmount.
	2.	The admin creates a pool using the static bondAmount and leverageAmount.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

	1.	The pool may be created with an unintended ratio of reserve tokens to bond and leverage amounts.
	2.	Imbalanced pool dynamics could disrupt token utility and economic stability, potentially impacting user confidence in the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent this issue, dynamically calculate bondAmount and leverageAmount based on the total reserveAmount at the time of pool creation.
