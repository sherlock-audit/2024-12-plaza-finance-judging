# Unvalidated Bond/Leverage Token Ratios in Pool Creation Enables Permanent Protocol Insolvency

## Summary
A severe vulnerability in the PreDeposit contract allows creation of fundamentally broken pools through unvalidated bondAmount and leverageAmount parameters. This can create permanently imbalanced pools that violate the protocol's core economic model and affect all depositors.

## Vulnerability Details

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L149

```solidity
function createPool() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (reserveAmount == 0) revert NoReserveAmount();
    if (bondAmount == 0 || leverageAmount == 0) revert InvalidBondOrLeverageAmount();
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
    
    IERC20(params.reserveToken).approve(address(factory), reserveAmount);
    pool = factory.createPool(params, reserveAmount, bondAmount, leverageAmount, 
                            bondName, bondSymbol, leverageName, leverageSymbol, true);
    
    emit PoolCreated(pool);
    poolCreated = true;
}
```

The critical issue is that bondAmount and leverageAmount are set by the owner without any validation of their ratios:

```solidity
function setBondAndLeverageAmount(uint256 _bondAmount, uint256 _leverageAmount) 
    external onlyOwner
```

## Impact
The lack of ratio validation in pool initialization creates structurally broken pools that cannot fulfill their core functions. By setting imbalanced bondAmount and leverageAmount values, the owner can create pools where the protocol cannot mathematically sustain its coupon payment obligations or where levETH tokens fail to provide meaningful leverage exposure. Since pools cannot be modified after creation, these fundamental flaws persist throughout the pool's lifetime. Every user participating in such a pool receives tokens that cannot function as designed - bondETH holders face guaranteed coupon payment failures, while levETH holders receive ineffective leverage exposure. This completely undermines the protocol's ability to provide its promised financial products.

## Proof of Concept
Malicious/incorrect initialization:
1. Owner sets bondAmount far too high relative to reserveAmount
2. Results in severely undercollateralized bondETH
3. Protocol cannot generate sufficient USDC for coupons
4. System permanently broken from launch

## Recommended Mitigation

Add strict validation of token ratios:

```solidity
function setBondAndLeverageAmount(uint256 _bondAmount, uint256 _leverageAmount) 
    external onlyOwner {
    // Validate total token amount matches deposits
    require(_bondAmount + _leverageAmount == reserveAmount, 
            "Invalid total token amount");
            
    // Enforce minimum collateralization ratio for bondETH
    uint256 minCollateral = (_bondAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE) / 
                           getOraclePrice(params.reserveToken);
    require(reserveAmount >= minCollateral, 
            "Insufficient collateral for bonds");
            
    // Ensure meaningful leverage for levETH
    require(_leverageAmount >= reserveAmount / MAX_LEVERAGE, 
            "Leverage ratio too high");
            
    bondAmount = _bondAmount;
    leverageAmount = _leverageAmount;
}
```

This vulnerability must be fixed before launch as it threatens the entire protocol's viability and could permanently damage user funds through improperly structured products.
