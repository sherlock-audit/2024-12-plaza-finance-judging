# New users cannot create tokens

### Summary

The first time we call the function create() to create new tokens, no bondTokens will be created. In `Pool.sol:323(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L314)` , the transaction will revert with the error: ZeroDebtSupply() when checking if bondSupply is equal to 0. The problem is that we cannot mint BondTokens. Due to this revert, the user won't be able to create any tokens.

### Root Cause

In Pool.sol: getCreateAmount() we check for bondSupply to not be empty, but it is possible for bondSupply to be 0. 
```solidity
 if (bondSupply == 0) {
            revert ZeroDebtSupply();
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user will try to create tokens for the first time, without any bondTokens created.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The user will call the function create(), which in turn calls _create(). Afterwards, _create() calls simulateCreate(). In the simulateCreate() function, we retrieve the bondSupply using the following line of code: 
```solidity 
uint256 bondSupply = bondToken.totalSupply().normalizeTokenAmount(address(bondToken), COMMON_DECIMALS);
```
 However, if this is the first time the function is called, no tokens will have been minted, resulting in bondSupply being set to 0. After completing simulateCreate(), the function calls getCreateAmount(), where it checks if bondSupply is equal to 0. This will cause a revert because bondSupply will indeed be 0.

### Impact

This issue is preventing any tokens to be minted at all.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Will need to keep in mind that the user might be new. Calculation must be adjusted to work around the 0 bondSupply for new users.
