# There isn't data feed in term of USD for all assets mentioned in Readme

### Summary

There isn't data feed in term of USD for all assets mentioned in Readme 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L290

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L68

### Impact

protocol team cannot choose some assets like wstETH as a reserve token

### PoC

there isn't data feed in term of dollar for some assets like wstETH in base network and this causes some functions like `BalancerOracleAdapter::latestRoundData` and `OracleReader::getOraclePrice` wouldn't work properly and also they cannot use ETH data feed instead of because ETH price is differ from wstETH price

### Mitigation

take consider to get price in term of ETH and then convert that to USD
