# Incorrect fee accounting.

## Bug description
When calling `create()` or `redeem()` the protocol simulates taking the fee so reserves used to compute the rate are reduced by the fee 'taken'.

[Pool.sol#L273](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273)
```solidity
 // Calculate and subtract fees from poolReserves
 poolReserves =
     poolReserves -
     (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) /
     (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
```

However, the protocol does not update `lastFeeClaimTime` since the fee was not actually taken, which creates a problem in the fee accounting. 

Let's say the last fee was taken at timestamp T1. When user deposits at T2 the function simulates taking the fee from T1 to T2 before deposit but does not update `lastFeeClaimTime` to T2. Because of that when user redeems at timestamp T3 he will be charged the fee from T1 to T3 even though they only spent T2 to T3 time in the vault.

## Root cause
Simulating taking the fee instead of actually doing it before every `create` and `redeem`, thus not updating `lastFeeClaimTime` timestamp.

## Attack path
No attack path, the scenario of how this can happen is explained in bug description section.

## Impact
Users incur fee for the time they didn't spend in the vault.

## Recommended Mitigation
Instead of simulating taking the fee, take the actual fee before every `create` and `redeem` so the `lastClaimTime` is correctly updated.
