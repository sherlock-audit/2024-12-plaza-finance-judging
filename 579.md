# Malicious User Can Inflate Rewards, Depleting the Pool for Honest Users.

### Summary


The current implementation allows users to exploit reward distribution by minting a large amount of `BondToken` before an auction, inflating the `totalSupply`, and claiming rewards even after redeeming their tokens. This results in an unfair allocation of coupon rewards and forces the pool to sell other users' reserve tokens to meet the `totalBuyCouponAmount`. 


### Root Cause


If a user holds the `BondToken` at the time of `startAuction`, the coupon amount to distribute is calculated based on the `totalSupply` of `BondToken`. Additionally, the `increaseIndexedAssetPeriod` function in the `BondToken` contract is called, which increments the value of `globalPool.currentPeriod++`. When this value is updated, the mapping `userAssets[user].lastUpdatedPeriod = period;` is updated for the user at the time of minting `BondToken`, making them eligible to claim rewards because the period has been increased.

```solidity
  function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
    
    //..

    uint256 normalizedTotalSupply = bondToken.totalSupply().normalizeAmount(bondDecimals, maxDecimals);
    uint256 normalizedShares = sharesPerToken.normalizeAmount(sharesDecimals, maxDecimals);

    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)
        .toBaseUnit(maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

    //..

    // Increase the bond token period
    bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);
    //..
  }

```

After the `startAuction` transaction is executed, if a user burns their `BondETH` token and receives their reserve tokens, the updated function in `BondToken` will update the index for that user and calculate their share. This is because the `globalPool.currentPeriod` is now updated, and `userAssets[user].lastUpdatedPeriod` stores the last period. As a result, the `getIndexedUserAmount` function will return the user's share and store it in `userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares`.

```solidity
  function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused() {
    if (from != address(0)) {
      updateIndexedUserAssets(from, balanceOf(from));
    }

    if (to != address(0)) {
      updateIndexedUserAssets(to, balanceOf(to));
    }

    super._update(from, to, amount);
  }


  function updateIndexedUserAssets(address user, uint256 balance) internal {
    uint256 period = globalPool.currentPeriod;
    uint256 shares = getIndexedUserAmount(user, balance, period);
    
@>    userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares = shares;
@>    userAssets[user].lastUpdatedPeriod = period;

    emit UpdatedUserAssets(user, period, shares);
  }


  function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
@>      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }
```

Whenever the auction finishes successfully and the pool transfers coupon tokens to the distributor contract, the user can call the `claim` function. Even if the user no longer holds any `BondToken`, `getIndexedUserAmount` will return the stored amount of shares, `userPool.indexedAmountShares`, that the user had and transfer that share to the user.


```solidity
  function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    //... 
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
@>    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

    //...
     couponAmountToDistribute -= shares;    
@>    bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
    //...
```

**So, based on that, some issues arise:**

1. If a user mints a huge amount of `BondToken` before the auction starts and then redeems all their reserve tokens, they will still receive the share without any incentive to hold the `BondToken`.

2. If a user mints a large amount of `BondToken` before the auction and then redeems all their reserve tokens after the `startAuction`, the auction contract will sell the reserve tokens of other users. This malicious user will have no reserve tokens left in the pool, and the reserve tokens of others will be sold to fulfill the `totalBuyCouponAmount` and then that user will also claim the share.

3. If a malicious user mints a huge amount of `BondToken` before the auction starts, the `couponAmountToDistribute` will be very large because it is calculated based on the `BondToken` total supply. In the auction, the pool will sell a lot of reserve tokens to fulfill the `totalBuyCouponAmount`.

### Impact

This issue enables malicious users to unfairly claim rewards, depleting the pool’s reserves and harming honest participants. By minting a large number of `BondTokens` before an auction, can inflate the `couponAmountToDistribute` and claim rewards without maintaining any Bond token. This leads to reserve token depletion, forces the pool to sell other users’ assets, and disrupts the fair allocation of rewards.

### Mitigation

I hope the Lead Security Researcher provides the mitigation, or the developers implement the mitigation for this issue, as the protocol logic is complex in here, making it difficult for me to suggest an effective solution.
