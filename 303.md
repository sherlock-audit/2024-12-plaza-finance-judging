# BondOracleAdapter Lacks Storage Gaps

### Summary

The `BondOracleAdapter` contract is supposed to be `upgradeable`, but it **does not include** storage gaps or contract-specific storage allocations. This **breaks its upgradeability condition and could lead to future compatibility issues**.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L18

The contract is upgradeable, yet it lacks storage gaps or specific storage slots. This oversight creates potential compatibility issues for future upgrades and increases the risk of storage collisions with other contracts.
