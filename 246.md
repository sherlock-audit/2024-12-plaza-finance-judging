### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Bond token holders get  coupons as usdc  for every period. Let’s assume, an account of bond token holders gets coupons as usdc for 4 periods but the account is not still claimed the usdc coupon tokens.

2. before claiming the usdc tokens, the account(bond token holders) is blaclisted for usdc.

3. now the account can’t claim usdc from distributor contract as the account(bond token holders) is blaclisted for usdc.

Another scenario, 
1. Bidders bid usdc to get reseve tokens.

2. after bidding if bidder index becomes lowestBidIndex, then bidder will be refunded his/her usdc.

3. now if the  lowestBidIndex bidder is blacklisted for usdc after bidding, then the lowestBidIndex bidder will not get his/her usdc and the  function bid will revert because _removeBid/ removeExcessBids will revert. As a result, the whole auction mechanism will be blocked/stucked.
