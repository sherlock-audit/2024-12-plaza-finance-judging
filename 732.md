# USDC blacklisting blocks bidding

### Summary

Every time a user bids on reserve tokens, if number of bids hits maximum lowest bid gets forcefully removed. Also after placing a bid if excess amounts of coupon tokens are present, excess bids are removed starting from the lowest indexes. The issue is that when USDC is used as coupon tokens and the contract tries to remove blacklisted user's bids and send USDC to them, it will revert, blocking other users from placing new bids.

### Root Cause

Refunding USDC to users by directly sending it to them when new bids are coming in.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Place a bid that is fairly low
2. Somehow get on the blacklist
3. Placed bid can not be removed, can also place other low bids to get all slots for cheap, just the blacklisted address should own the lowest bid

### Impact

Bids can be blocked, also this can be leveraged to buy reserve tokens for cheap.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of sending USDC directly when removing bids, keep internal accounts of this and let users claim their removed funds.
