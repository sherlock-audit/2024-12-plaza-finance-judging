# USDC can be locked in the pool contract

### Summary

In the pool USDC can be distribute by calling distribute the problem is that if another auction started in the mean time the the USDC of the previous auction will be locked forever.

### Root Cause

In the Pool contract we can distribute the usdcs from the succeeded auctions by calling distribute. 
As we can see we can only distribute the USDCs from the previous auction :

The problem is that nothing prevent users to start an auction before the previous auction have been distributed as we can see : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530-L543

Meaning that if the a user start an auction before the preivious one have been distributed the USDCs will be potentially locked forever. 
According to the README : 

Functions like distribute(), startAuction() at Pool or endAuction() at Auction contracts are meant to be called by anyone for legal reasons. Those methods have the appropriate constraints so they can only be called at the appropriate time. The startAuction function don't have the appropriate constraint.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The previous auction should have succeeded.

### External Pre-conditions

No user should have call distribute during delay between the two auctions

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Users will loss an amount of their coupon tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

As mitigation the pool should implement a safety check to prevent the user from calling startAuction before the distribution.
