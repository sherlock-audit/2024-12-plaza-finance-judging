# Incorrect redeem rate for leverage tokens if price feed for BondToken/USD is set

### Summary

When redeeming from a pool, after the `redeemRate` is calculated there is one last check:
```solidity
if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
      redeemRate = marketRate;
    }
```
If there has been a price feed for `BondToken`/USD set on `OracleFeeds`  and the market rate of `BondToken` is lower than the calculated `redeemRate`,  `redeemRate` will be updated to the market rate of `BondToken`.

This will happen even in the cases when the user is redeeming `LeverageToken`, meaning the redeem rate will be wrong.

### Root Cause

In [Pool::simulateRedeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L445) if the price feed for the pair `BondToken/USD` has been set, `marketRate` will be set to the price returned from the oracle.

Later, in [Pool::getRedeemAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L519) if the `marketRate` is less than the calculated `redeemRate`, the `redeemRate` will become the `marketRate`.

The issue is that this is not restricted to `BondToken` redemptions and can happen when redeeming `LeverageToken`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `OracleFeeds` needs to have a price feed set for `BondToken`/USD.

### Mitigation

```diff
-  if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
+  if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND && marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
      redeemRate = marketRate;
    }
```
