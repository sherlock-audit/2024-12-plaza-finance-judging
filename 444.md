# Pool fee collection methodology will incorrect penalize depositors

### Summary

When depositing and withdrawing, the fee is taken based on the entire NAV of the pool as a time based streaming fee. This means that the fee should be taken based on the current NAV and the amount of time that NAV has been in the contract. The issue with the implementation is that it is incorrectly calculated and will take fees retroactively from new user deposits. 

### Root Cause

[Pool#getFeeAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L718-L720) claims fees for all funds for all time since last claim

### Internal preconditions

Fee has not been claimed recently

### External preconditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Fee has not been claimed for 1 year
2. User mints 100 leverage token for 100 ETH
3. User immediately loses ~5.5% of value to fee

### Impact

Contract take too many fees, incorrectly penalizing depositors

### POC

Tests for all vulnerabilities can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/IAm0x52/05589415ce45af83aa4f7a5f63afbf45).

Insert the following test into Pool.t.sol

    function testIncorrectFeeCalc() public {
        //test setup
        setEthPrice(1000e8);

        Pool.TokenType bondTokenType = Pool.TokenType(0);
        Pool.TokenType levTokenType = Pool.TokenType(1);

        Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);

        rToken.mint(governance, 1e20);
        vm.prank(governance);
        rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 1e20);

        string memory salt = "test";
        PoolFactory.PoolParams memory _params = params;
        _params.fee = 100000;
        
        // create pool
        vm.prank(governance);
        Pool _pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(_params, 1e20, 1e20, 1e20, "", salt, "", "", false));

        // test deposit with no fee accumulated
        rToken.mint(user2, 1e20);
        vm.prank(user2);
        rToken.approve(address(_pool), type(uint256).max);

        uint256 beforeBalance = rToken.balanceOf(user2);

        vm.startPrank(user2);
        uint256 amount = _pool.create(levTokenType, beforeBalance, 0);

        _pool.redeem(levTokenType, amount, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 difference = beforeBalance - rToken.balanceOf(user2);
        rToken.mint(user2, difference);

        // only loss is small rounding error
        console.log(difference);

        vm.warp(365 days);

        setEthPrice(1000e8);

        vm.startPrank(user2);
        amount = _pool.create(levTokenType, beforeBalance, 0);

        _pool.redeem(levTokenType, amount, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();

        difference = beforeBalance - rToken.balanceOf(user2);

        // user retroactively pay fees on entire amount
        console.log(difference);
    }

    Output:

    [PASS] testIncorrectFeeCalc() (gas: 1918623)
    Logs: 
        1
        5625000353906248674

We see in the above test that the first user deposits 100 ETH and upon immediate withdraw receives 100 ETH back less a single wei. After the time is warped forward and we test the same scenario again we see that they immediately loses 5.625 ETH. This is incorrect as the fee is time based and therefore the user should only be subject to fees that accumulate during the time they are actively in the vault.

### Mitigation

Every time there is a withdraw, deposit or transfer of underlying in or out of the contract the fee should be cached and update prior
