# There is no validation for `totalSellReserveAmount` after auction ends

## Summary

After the auction ends successfully, `totalSellReserveAmount` of reserve tokens are transferred from pool to auction. However, this value is not validated and so, auction will receive more reserve tokens.

## Root Cause

After the auction ends, [Auction.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336-L350) :: `endAuction()` function is invoked.

This function only checks whether `currentCouponAmount` is fewer than `totalBuyCouponAmount` and doesn't validate `totalSellReserveAmount`.

Then, it invokes `Pool.transferReserveToAuction()` function to transfer `totalSellReserveAmount` of reserve tokens from pool.

```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

Also, in the [Pool.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L577-L583) :: `transferReserveToAuction.()` function, it doesn't validate the value of `amount`.

```solidity
  function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```

Therefore, any bidder can claim the tokens for their bid regardless of price when the auction is succeeded. Since the conditions are that `currentCouponAmount` is not fewer than `totalBuyCouponAmount` and `totalSellReserveAmount` is fewer than 0.9 times of reserve tokens in the pool, the auction can be easily succeeded regardless to the price of bids.

As a result, the pool will transfer more reserve tokens to auction and the protocol lose funds.

## Impact

The pool transfers more reserve tokens to auction and the protocol will lose funds.

## Mitigation

Implement the validation for `totalSellReserveAmount` or minimum price for bidders.
