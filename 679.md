# There will be precision loss in pool contract

### Summary

When user redeem his bond or leverage token, there will be the calculation of redeem rate which is done in the `getRedeemAmount` function. While calculating redeem rate eth price needs be converted to a base unit by division. This conversion is done when calculating the tvl, which may lead to a loss of precision in subsequent calculations.

Calculation of redeem rate can be ended up to returning a zero value. The second reason for that is `PRECISION` is multiplied after division while calculating redeem rate.

```solidity
function getRedeemAmount(
    TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 bondSupply,
    uint256 levSupply,
    uint256 poolReserves,
    uint256 ethPrice,
    uint8 oracleDecimals,
    uint256 marketRate
  ) public pure returns(uint256) {
    if (bondSupply == 0) {
      revert ZeroDebtSupply();
    }

@>  uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
    uint256 assetSupply = bondSupply;
    uint256 multiplier = POINT_EIGHT;

...    
    // Calculate the redeem rate based on the collateral level and token type
    uint256 redeemRate;
    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
@>    redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
    } else {
      redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
    }
...
  }
```
Here, @> for redeem rate calculation, asset supply is divided after that `PRECISION` is multiplied this value which is not correct as it can lead to precision loss and can also return 0 value. Also in getCreateAmout` function there is similar kind of precision loss can happen which can return 0 value.




### Root Cause

Division is done before multiplication.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

In the formula to calculate redeem rate, there are chances that it will return 0 value because of rounding down issues.
User who wants to redeem his bond or leverage token will call redeem function.
In redeem, getRedeemAmount function is called where redeem rate is calculated.
But due to rounding down redeem rate can be 0 which means user will get 0 amount so transaction may fail.

### Impact

Redeem amount can be 0 due to precision loss which may lead to failed transaction and also precision loss for the user.

### Mitigation

Protocol should make sure that multiplication should be done before division in calculation of redeem rate.
