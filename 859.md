# Incorrect Tick Calculation for Negative Ticks in TWAP Implementation May Lead to Manipulatable Price Feeds

### Summary

The protocol’s TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) calculation logic does not correctly handle cases where the average tick is negative. Specifically, when `(tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0])` is negative and not evenly divisible by `twapInterval`, the tick calculation truncates toward zero instead of rounding down. This results in an overestimated tick value and incorrect TWAP prices, which may open the protocol to manipulation or arbitrage opportunities.

This issue was identified by referencing similar findings, such as [Issue M-18](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-salty-findings/issues/380), where rounding errors in tick calculations caused incorrect TWAP values.

### Root Cause

In [`BondOracleAdapter.sol::110`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L110), within the `latestRoundData` function, the tick calculation logic does not handle negative tick differences correctly. Specifically, it truncates towards zero when dividing negative values instead of rounding down, leading to an overestimated tick value.

This truncation issue stems from Solidity's division behavior, which does not align with the rounding logic in Uniswap’s library, potentially causing inaccurate TWAP calculations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The code assumes that dividing `tickCumulatives` by `twapInterval` always yields an accurate average tick without handling negative rounding explicitly.

### External Pre-conditions

The cumulative tick difference (`tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]`) is negative and not divisible by `twapInterval` without a remainder.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker identifies that the TWAP logic overestimates the tick when the cumulative tick difference is negative.
2. They manipulate the pool’s tick trajectory to create scenarios where the tick is consistently overestimated.
3. The incorrect TWAP value propagates through the protocol, causing:
   - Inaccurate pricing.
   - Potential arbitrage opportunities.
   - Deviation from expected functionality in downstream contracts relying on TWAP prices.

### Impact

- **Protocol Impact:** Incorrect TWAP calculations may lead to inaccurate pricing, increasing the risk of financial loss or exploitation through arbitrage.
- **User Impact:** Users interacting with the protocol may face unfavorable collateral valuation conditions due to mispriced assets.
- **System Stability:** Functions relying on accurate TWAP prices, such as price-dependent operations, may fail or behave unexpectedly, impacting the protocol’s reliability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address this issue, the tick calculation logic should explicitly handle negative values and ensure proper rounding. The following adjustment can be made:

```solidity
int56 tickDifference = tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0];
int24 averageTick = int24(tickDifference / int56(uint56(twapInterval)));

// Adjust for rounding when tickDifference is negative and not evenly divisible by twapInterval
if (tickDifference < 0 && tickDifference % int56(uint56(twapInterval)) != 0) {
    averageTick--; // Round down for negative values
}
```

This adjustment aligns the rounding behavior with [Uniswap’s library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/libraries/OracleLibrary.sol#L36) and ensures accurate TWAP calculations.
