# Users cannot claims their coupon tokens when the bond token contract is paused.

## Bug description
To claim coupon tokens, users must calls `Distributor::claim()` function. When this function is called subsequently it calls `bondToken::resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender)` to set the last updated period for the user to the current period and reset user's shares back to 0 to signal that user has claimed his coupon tokens up to the current period.

[Distributor.sol#L106](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L106)
```solidity
bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
```

However, `resetIndexUserAssets()` function has the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which means that when the bond token contract is paused, user won't be able to claim their coupon tokens.

[BondToken.sol#L207](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L207)
```solidity
function resetIndexedUserAssets(address user) external onlyRole(DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused() {
```

Pausing of the bond token contract should not affect claim operations of the distributor contract considering no transfer of bond tokens is happening during `Distributor::claim()`. 

## Root cause
Applying `whenNotPaused` modifier to `resetIndexedUserAssets()` function.

## Attack path
No attack path

## Impact
When the bond contract is paused, users are unable to claim their coupon tokens.
## Recommended Mitigation
Remove `whenNotPaused` modifier from `resetIndexedUserAssets()` function of the bond contract.
