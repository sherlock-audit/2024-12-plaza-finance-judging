# There is no upgradability to state variables initialized in `PoolFactory.sol` again, in case of new upgrade of PoolFactory contract.

### Summary

In `PoolFactory.sol` there are many state variable, that initialized during initialization phase.

```js
  function initialize(
    address _governance,
    address _deployer,
    address _oracleFeeds,
    address _poolImplementation,
    address _bondImplementation,
    address _leverageImplementation,
    address _distributorImplementation
  ) initializer public {
    __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
    __Pausable_init();

@-> deployer = Deployer(_deployer);
@-> governance = _governance;
@-> oracleFeeds = _oracleFeeds;
    _grantRole(GOV_ROLE, _governance);

@-> poolBeacon = _poolImplementation;
@-> bondBeacon = _bondImplementation;
@-> leverageBeacon = _leverageImplementation;
@-> distributorBeacon = _distributorImplementation;
  }
```
And thorughout the code there is no functionality to update these values(marked as `@`), the problem arises during upgradation of `PoolFactory.sol`. beacause `initialize` function is being called with `initializer` modifier which can only be called once.

Now when there will be any future upgradation, these state variables will still be same, which is an unexpected behavior. The expected behavior is that whenever `PoolFactory.sol` upgraded to new implementation, there should be new `deployer`, `governance` and all other state variables marked as `@`.

### Root Cause
No functionality to upgrade the state variables marked as `@` during upgradation.

### Impact
If the contract cannot be reinitialized after an upgrade, new versions of the contract may not be able to configure crucial state variables, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Mitigation
- Using the `onlyInitializing` modifier rather than `initializer` when creating functions that need to be called during     upgrades. This allows the function to be executed during upgrades, without restricting it to a single use. here it `initialize()` function.

- The onlyInitializing modifier ensures that the function can be called whenever the contract is being initialized or reinitialized during an upgrade, preventing the contract from locking out future upgrades.

- Implement upgradation functions, that needs to be called during reinitialization or upgradation.
