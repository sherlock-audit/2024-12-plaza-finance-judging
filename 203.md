# Distributor Coupon Exploitation Risk from Bond Token Balance Manipulation in Pool Contract

### Summary


The `Pool.sol`  missing checks for contemporary creation and redemption of bond token, enable users to manipulate their token balance . This manipulation leads to inaccurate `balanceOf()` calculations, allowing exploitation of the `Distributor.sol`'s  `claim()` function and draining its shares.

### Root Cause

The balance required for claimable share calculation inside the `claim()` function is fetched via the `balanceOf()` function rather than reading a state variable:

```Solidity
  function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    BondToken bondToken = Pool(pool).bondToken();

    // Omitting the code

    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

    // The rest of the code

  }
```

This dynamic balance fetching will lead to manipulation of bond tokens inside the Pool contract with flash minting.

### Attack Path


1. Attacker, takes out a flash loan to acquire a large amount of reserve tokens.
2. He calls the `create()` function in the Pool contract by Using these tokens and temporarily increasing his bond token balance.
3. He then invokes the `claim()` function in the Distributor contract to receive a large number of shares.
4. Afterward, he calls the `redeem()` function in the Pool contract to reverse the bond token creation.
5. Finally, he repays the flash loan with the reserve tokens, keeping the shares as profit.

### Impact

Flash loans can temporarily inflate bond token balances, allowing the shares of `Distributor.sol`  to be drained.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The `Pool.sol` contract should prevent simultaneous creation and redemption within a single transaction to eliminate temporary fluctuations in the bond token balance.
