# Incorrect Market Rate Oracle Feed Used For LevETH Redemptions

### Summary

In the Pool contract's [`simulateRedeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L446) function, the market rate for both `BondETH` and `LevETH` redemptions is fetched from the BondToken's price feed. This means LevETH redemptions are comparing their redemption rate against the wrong market price, potentially leading to incorrect redemption amounts.


### Root Cause

In simulateRedeem, the market rate is fetched using BondToken's price feed regardless of token type:
```javascript
function simulateRedeem(TokenType tokenType, uint256 depositAmount) public view returns(uint256) {
    // ... other code ...
    
    uint256 marketRate;
    // ISSUE: Always uses bondToken price feed
    address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(address(bondToken), USD);
    if (feed != address(0)) {
        marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD)
            .normalizeAmount(
                getOracleDecimals(address(bondToken), USD), 
                oracleDecimals
            );
    }

    return getRedeemAmount(
        tokenType,
        depositAmount,
        bondSupply,
        levSupply,
        poolReserves,
        getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD),
        oracleDecimals,
        marketRate  // Using wrong market rate for LevETH
    );
}
```
For LevETH redemptions, this means:

1. The market rate check compares LevETH redemption rate against BondETH's market price
2. Could lead to incorrect redemption amounts if BondETH and LevETH have different market prices
3. Violates the token's economic design where they should have independent market prices
