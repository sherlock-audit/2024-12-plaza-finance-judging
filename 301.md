# An Attacker Can Almost Completely Drain the Protocol

### Summary

The `Auction` contract allows users to bid for `underlying assets` (commonly Balancer LPs) using `buyCouponToken` (likely USDC) within a specific time frame. Once the auction ends, any user can call `endAuction` to finalize it and begin distributing the LP tokens.

However, an attacker can fill the `maxBids` with their own bids, purchasing up to `poolSaleLimit` in exchange for `totalBuyCouponAmount`. This effectively **creates a denial-of-service (DoS)** for other participants, allowing the attacker to acquire assets at an extremely low price.

### Root Cause

The attack is possible due to two factors:

* The protocol automatically refunds the `sellCouponAmount` of the `lowestBid` when a new, more attractive bid is submitted.

* The `couponToken` is planned to be a token like `USDC`, which is subject to external regulations.

These properties allow an attacker to create a DoS by preventing refunds for the lowestBid using external constraints (e.g., blacklisting), blocking others from submitting new bids. This allows the attacker to wait until the auction ends, acquiring the poolSaleLimit at a significantly undervalued price.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction started recently.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Start a new auction.

2. The attacker submits low-value bids to fill the `maxBids`, ensuring the total `buyReserveAmount` matches the `totalBuyCouponAmount`, and the combined `buyReserveAmount` equals `poolSaleLimit`.

3. The attacker ensures the addresses associated with the `lowestBid` are `blacklisted` (e.g., by interacting with a protocol prohibited by regulations).

4. At this point, any new bids attempting to replace the lowestBid **fail** due to the **inability to refund the couponToken**.

5. The attacker waits until the auction ends and then calls `endAuction`.

### Impact

This attack allows the protocol to be drained almost entirely at an absurdly low cost, severely damaging its intended function and financial stability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of refunding the `couponAmount` during the bid process, store the refundable amounts in a `mapping refunds` that users can access to claim their refunds separately.
