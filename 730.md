# Loss of precision when calculating the redeem rate.

### Summary

When calculating the redeem rate based on the collateral level and token type, the value is multiplied by PRECISION after the division, which is wrong because of the loss of decimals in this calculation.


### Root Cause

In `Pool.sol` , `getRedeemAmount` function, there is an error in the sequence of calculations for precision.

`redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;` - wrong
`redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION)  / assetSupply;` - correct

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user who wants to get their collateral back needs to call [`redeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L366) function.
