# Users Can Receive Zero Tokens Due to Rounding in PreDeposit Share Calculation

### Summary

In PreDeposit contract, if bondAmount and leverageAmount are set too low relative to reserveAmount, users will receive zero tokens when claiming due to division rounding down, regardless of admin's intentions. This can happen through misconfiguration since there are no minimum thresholds enforced.

### Root Cause

In PreDeposit.sol, the share calculation divides by reserveAmount which can round down to zero if bondAmount or leverageAmount are set too low:

```solidity
uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;
uint256 userLeverageShare = (leverageAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;

balances[msg.sender] = 0;
```

If bondAmount * userBalance < reserveAmount, the division will round down to 0, causing users to receive no tokens. This can happen unintentionally since the reserveAmount is unknown at the beginning of the predeposit.

For example:

User deposits 100 tokens
Total reserveAmount is 10000
bondAmount is set to 99 (potentially by mistake)
User's share: (99 * 100) / 10000 = 0
User receives 0 tokens due to rounding and has it balance update to 0

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin update the bondAmount or leverageAmount storage variables to lower values than reserveAmount

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users may receive zero tokens due to rounding in share calculations if protocol parameters are not carefully set. While the admin is trusted, the lack of minimum thresholds makes the system susceptible to configuration errors.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make bondAmount and leverageAmount bigger than reserveCap so the division won't round down to 0

Or implement a minimum deposit amount
