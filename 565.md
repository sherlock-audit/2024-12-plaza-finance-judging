# A malicious attacker can prevent distribution of reserve and coupon tokens to other callers

### Summary

The function `faucet (...)` allows for distribution of reserve and coupon tokens to various users as seen below: 
```solidity
function faucet(uint256 amountWstETH, uint256 amountCbETH, uint256 amountCoupon, uint256 amountEth, address[] memory users) public isWhitelisted() {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
      address user = users[i];
      faucet(amountWstETH, amountCbETH, amountCoupon, amountEth, user);
    }
  }
```
It takes an array of users then loops through the array and transfers `ETH` as 
```solidity
if (amountEth > 0) {
      (bool success, ) = payable(user).call{value: amountEth}(""); //@audit griefing to prevent below using faucet and expend the gas
      require(success, "Faucet: ETH transfer failed");
    }
```
It is observed, that the `faucet (...)` uses `.call` which forwards all the gas to the recipient. In the event the recipient is a malicious contract, it can consume all the gas therefore preventing withdrawals of other users. 

It is worth to note that there is a `faucet (...)` function that can be used to process individual withdrawals therefore reducing the severity of the issue. 

### Root Cause

The `faucet (...)` function [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Faucet.sol#L71) uses the low level `call` to send ether as seen 
```solidity
function faucet(uint256 amountWstETH, uint256 amountCbETH, uint256 amountCoupon, uint256 amountEth, address onBehalfOf) public isWhitelisted() {
    address user = onBehalfOf == address(0) ? msg.sender : onBehalfOf;
    if (amountWstETH > 0) {
      wstETH.mint(user, amountWstETH);
    }
    if (amountCbETH > 0) {
      cbETH.mint(user, amountCbETH);
    }
    if (amountCoupon > 0) {
      couponToken.mint(user, amountCoupon);
    }
    if (amountEth > 0) {
      (bool success, ) = payable(user).call{value: amountEth}(""); //@audit griefing to prevent below using faucet and expend the gas
      require(success, "Faucet: ETH transfer failed");
    }
  }
```
If the recipient is a smart contract, it can have a logic to consume the forwarded gas from the call to prevent subsequent distributions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. One of the users addresses needs to be a malicious smart contract that has a logic to spend all the forwarded gas and added to the user's array by the whitelisted address.

### Impact

Multiple distribution via `faucet (...)` function will be impossible. The whitelisted account would need to carefully select the user's addresses to ensure it is not a malicious contract or only do single distribution at a time.
