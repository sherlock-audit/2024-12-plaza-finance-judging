# BondToken holders will not get shares if auction fails.

### Summary

when a auction gets failed then it cannot create a new auction untill the next distribution period is over as it is updating the lastDistribution at the time of creating auction.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L532

```javascript
    function startAuction() external whenNotPaused {
@>      require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod < block.timestamp, DistributionPeriodNotPassed());
@>      require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());
        .
        .
        .
@>      lastDistribution = block.timestamp;
```

When a auction fails it cannot be created again because it needs to wait for the distribution period to over. This happens because it is updating the `lastDistribution` to `block.timestamp` at the time of creating the auction. So even if the auction fails `lastDistribution` is sets to `block.timestamp` means another `distributionPeriod` needs to be waited before calling `startAuction()` again.
