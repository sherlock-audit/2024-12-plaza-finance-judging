# `Pool.transferReserveToAuction` does not correctly reduce `currentPeriod` to transfer `reserveTokens` to Auction

## Summary

`Pool.transferReserveToAuction` cannot transfer reserveToken to the Auction of the previous period once auction ends

## Vulnerability Details

Whenever an auction is started in `Pool.startAuction`, the `currentPeriod` of bondToken will be incremented by 1.

```solidity
  function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
    ...
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool(); // @audit starts auction with currentPeriod
    require(auctions[currentPeriod] == address(0), AuctionAlreadyStarted());

    uint8 bondDecimals = bondToken.decimals();
    uint8 sharesDecimals = bondToken.SHARES_DECIMALS();
    uint8 maxDecimals = bondDecimals > sharesDecimals ? bondDecimals : sharesDecimals;

    uint256 normalizedTotalSupply = bondToken.totalSupply().normalizeAmount(bondDecimals, maxDecimals);
    uint256 normalizedShares = sharesPerToken.normalizeAmount(sharesDecimals, maxDecimals);

    // Calculate the coupon amount to distribute
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)
        .toBaseUnit(maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

    auctions[currentPeriod] = Utils.deploy(
      address(new Auction()),
      abi.encodeWithSelector(
        Auction.initialize.selector,
        address(couponToken),
        address(reserveToken),
        couponAmountToDistribute,
        block.timestamp + auctionPeriod,
        1000,
        address(this),
        poolSaleLimit
      )
    );

    // Increase the bond token period
    bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken); // @audit currentPeriod is incremented by 1

    // Update last distribution time
    lastDistribution = block.timestamp;
  }
```

Once the auction succeeds and `Auction.endAuction` is called, the Pool is suppose to transfer the total `reserveAmount` sold to the Auction for bidders to claim. However, this will not happen since the Pool does not decrement the currentPeriod to retrieve the latest Auction that ended in order to send the reserveToken.

```solidity
  function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool(); // @audit currentPeriod retrieved is already incremented
    address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod]; // @audit auctionAddress will not return latest Auction that ended
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction()); // @audit this reverts

    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```

## POC

Consider the following scenario

1. At currentPeriod = 0, an auction is started via `Pool.startAuction`. `currentPeriod` is incremented to `1`
2. After some time (10 days per docs), the auction ends and `Auction.endAuction` is called
3. This will trigger `Pool.transferReserveToAuction`. Since `currentPeriod = 1`, auctionAddress will be 0x0 assuming no auction has started. Even if an auction has started, the wrong Auction address wil be retrieved.
4. `Auction.endAuction` reverts and no reserves can be transferred from `Pool` to `Auction` since the Auction callling `Pool.transferReserveToAuction` is not the same as `auctionAddress` retrieved
5. `reserveTokens` in the `Pool` to be send to the `Auction` are stuck in the `Pool` since `currentPeriod` can never be decremented

## Impact

Reserve tokens cannot be claimed by bidders since they cannot be transferred from the `Pool` to the `Auction` contract.

## Mitigation

Decrement the `currentPeriod` to retrieve the `previousPeriod` (similar to `Pool.distribute`) such that `reserveToken` can be transferred to the latest `Auction` that has ended
