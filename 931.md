# BondOracleAdapter can fetch price from inefficient Pool on Aerodrome

### Summary

The `BondOracleAdapter`'s `getPool` function can select an inefficient pool, leading to inappropriate price feeds. An attacker can create a pool with an extremely low fee and inefficient tick spacing, which the adapter might prioritize, leading to a skewed price oracle.

### Root Cause

The `getPool` function in [`BondOracleAdapter.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L122C5-L122C90) iterates through an array of tick spacings (`spacing`) without considering the expected trading activity or fee structure for a Bond/USD pair that is a volatile pool.  It prioritizes pools with tighter tick spacing, even if they are inefficient.  The documentation ([no link provided in the original prompt](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/docs/blob/main/content/liquidity.mdx#concentrated-pools)) states:

> Concentrated Liquidity Tick Spacing
> In Velodrome's concentrated liquidity pools, the concept of tick spacing is used. This refers to the minimum price movement between liquidity ranges.
>
> Stable token pools use a price range boundary of 0.5% (tick space 50) for tokens like USDC, DAI, LUSD.
>
> Volatile token pools use a price range boundary of 2% (tick space 200) for tokens like OP and WETH.
>
> For highly correlated tokens like stable coins and liquid staked tokens, a price range boundary of 0.01% (tick space 1) is available.
>
> For emerging tokens like AERO and VELO, a price range boundary of 20% (tick space 2000) is available to reduce liquidity pool re-balance needs.

The lack of a fee check, allows an attacker to create a pool with a very low fee that the adapter might select, further distorting the price feed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker must deploy a Concentrated Liquidity pool on the same `dexFactory` with the same `bondToken` and `liquidityToken`, but with an inefficient tick spacing (e.g., 1).

### Attack Path

1. The attacker deploys a pool with a very tight tick spacing (e.g., 1).  This pool is likely inefficient for a Bond/USD pair.
2. When the adapter is initialized or fetches the price, the `getPool` function is called.
3.The `getPool` function iterates through the `spacing` array and finds the attacker's pool. Because it prioritizes tighter tick spacing and lacks a fee check, it selects the attacker's inefficient pool.
4.The adapter now uses the inefficient pool for price information. This pool is susceptible to manipulation due to low liquidity (people don't want to lp in this pool).

### Impact

If this feeds is till retains inside `Pool.sol`, the protocol and its users rely on a distorted market price for bond token.  The attacker can manipulate the price in their inefficient pool.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Modify the `getPool` function to prioritize pools based on expected trading behavior and fee structure for the Bond/USD pair. Consider factors like typical trading volume and volatility when selecting a suitable tick spacing.  For example, start with more reasonable tick spacing.
