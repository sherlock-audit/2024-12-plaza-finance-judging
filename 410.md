# Unclaimed rewards lockup in `Auction` and `Distributor` contracts

### Summary

In both the `Auction` and `Distributor` contracts, a  issue arises regarding unclaimed rewards. 

Starting with the `Auction` contract, consider a scenario where a user participates in the auction by depositing USDC to receive wstETH. If their bid wins and the auction succeeds, they become eligible to claim their reward. However, if the user never claims their reward—whether due to losing wallet access or simply forgetting—the wstETH tokens remain permanently locked within the contract.

A similar issue exists in the `Distributor` contract. If users never claim their allocated share of `couponAmountToDistribute`, USDC remains trapped in the contract with no mechanism to withdraw or redistribute it.

### Root Cause

The problem occurs because both contracts rely on users manually claiming their rewards instead of automatically transferring them. Consequently, unclaimed funds accumulate indefinitely since there is no owner-withdraw function in either contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The `Auction` contract successfully completes an auction, marking certain users as winners eligible to claim rewards.
The `Distributor` contract distributes coupons to users based on indexed assets.
The contract holds users' rewards but does not automatically transfer them.
No `onlyOwne`r or governance-controlled withdrawal function exists.

### External Pre-conditions

A user participates in an auction (Auction contract) or receives an allocation (Distributor contract).
The user fails to call `claim()`, either by accident or due to losing access to their wallet.
The system continues operating, potentially accumulating more unclaimed rewards over time.

### Attack Path

A user deposits `USDC` into the Auction contract, bidding for `wstETH`.
The user's bid wins, and they become eligible to claim `wstETH`.
The user does not claim their reward (e.g., loses wallet, forgets, or abandons the bid).
The contract retains the `wstETH` indefinitely, with no ability to withdraw or reallocate it.
Similarly, in the Distributor contract:

A user receives an allocation of coupon tokens.
The user does not claim the allocated tokens.
The contract holds the tokens indefinitely, leading to an increasing amount of unclaimed assets.

### Impact

If multiple winners fail to claim their rewards, large amounts of reserve tokens may remain locked.
   - There is no mechanism to recover these funds.

If a user never calls `claim()`, their allocated coupon tokens stay in the contract.
   - Over time, this could lead to an inaccurate `couponAmountToDistribute`.
   - The system may continue allocating coupons to users who never claim, leading to "ghost claims."
   - The contract does not reset expired claims, meaning allocated amounts never get recycled.

### PoC

// User wins an auction but does not claim their reward
contract AuctionPoC {
    function simulateWinningBid() public {
        auctionContract.bid{value: 1000}(100); // User bids and wins
        // User never calls auctionContract.claim(), funds remain stuck
    }
}

// Distributor contract fails to release coupons when users forget to claim
contract DistributorPoC {
    function simulateUnclaimedCoupons() public {
        distributorContract.allocate(1000);
        // Users never call distributorContract.claim()
        // USDC remains locked inside the contract
    }
}


### Mitigation

**Solution 1: Expiry Mechanism for Unclaimed Rewards**
Introduce a claim deadline (e.g., 30 days). If a user fails to claim within this period, the contract reclaims the tokens.

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public lastClaimTime;
uint256 public constant CLAIM_DEADLINE = 30 days;

function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    require(block.timestamp <= lastClaimTime[msg.sender] + CLAIM_DEADLINE, "Claim expired");

    BondToken bondToken = Pool(pool).bondToken();
    address couponToken = Pool(pool).couponToken();
    require(address(bondToken) != address(0) && couponToken != address(0), "Unsupported pool");

    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

    require(IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) >= shares, "Not enough balance");
    require(couponAmountToDistribute >= shares, "Not enough to distribute");

    couponAmountToDistribute -= shares;
    bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
    lastClaimTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;

    emit ClaimedShares(msg.sender, currentPeriod, shares);
}
```

##### **Solution 2: `sweepUnclaimedShares()` for Admin**
If rewards remain unclaimed for 30 days, an admin can reclaim and redistribute them.

```solidity
function sweepUnclaimedShares() external onlyRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE()) {
    require(block.timestamp > lastClaimTime[msg.sender] + CLAIM_DEADLINE, "Claim period still active");

    uint256 unclaimedAmount = IERC20(pool.couponToken()).balanceOf(address(this)) - couponAmountToDistribute;
    require(unclaimedAmount > 0, "No unclaimed shares");

    // Reallocate or return unclaimed shares
    IERC20(pool.couponToken()).safeTransfer(poolFactory.treasury(), unclaimedAmount);
    emit UnclaimedFundsSwept(unclaimedAmount);
}
```

##### **Solution 3: Auto-Claim on Allocation**
Modify `allocate()` to force claims for users with pending rewards before allocating new funds.

```solidity
function allocate(uint256 _amountToDistribute) external whenNotPaused {
    require(address(pool) == msg.sender, "Caller is not pool");

    // Force claim for users who haven't claimed yet
    _forceClaimAllUsers();

    address couponToken = pool.couponToken();
    couponAmountToDistribute += _amountToDistribute;

    require(IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) >= couponAmountToDistribute, "Not enough balance");
}
```
