# [M-01] Excessive fee time elapsed drains pool reserves, making minting/redeeming unfeasible in `Pool.sol`.

### Summary

Excessive time elapsed since `lastFeeClaimTime` results in draining `poolReserves`, resulting in unexpected fee deductions from `poolReserves` during minting and or redeeming simulations. This can drain the reserves and prevent minting/redeeming operations, disrupting the protocol's core functionality.


### Root Cause

-  Pool.sol:ln.273 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273
- and Pool.sol:ln.433 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433
- - -
In the `Pool:simulateCreate` and `Pool:simulateRedeem` function, `poolReserves` are adjusted by deducting accrued fees based on time elapsed since `lastFeeClaimTime`. If the elapsed time is excessively large, the fee deduction calculation can deplete `poolReserves`, effectively blocking minting or redeeming operations for derivative tokens, as both `Pool:_create` and `Pool:_redeem` rely on slippage checks with input param `minAmount`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A significant amount of time must pass without fees being claimed (no calls to `Pool:claimFees` as this is the only way of resetting the `lastFeeClaimTime` variable), causing `lastFeeClaimTime` to remain outdated.


### External Pre-conditions

The fee value set in the contract must be nonzero (as intended by the protocol), amplifying the impact of the elapsed time in fee deductions.

### Attack Path

Assume the following values:

poolReserves = 1,000 (units of the reserve token)
fee = 0.02 (2% annual fee)
lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp - 5 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 (5 years ago)

1. User calls `Pool:getPoolInfo` and sees that reserves are 1000 units
2. Based on this, he makes an assessment and calls `Pool:_create` (or respectevly `Pool:_redeem`) with expected minimum amount as one of the parameters
3. A subsequent call is made to `Pool:simulateCreate` (or respectevly `Pool:simulateRedeem`) where it calculates `poolReserves` by deducting accrued fees using the formula poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);  
If (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime) is excessively large, the resulting fee deduction substantially decreases `poolReserves` i.e.:
poolReserves = (1,000 * 0.02 * (5 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60)) / (1 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60) = 100 units (as uncollected fees but still part of `poolReserves`) 
4. The call to `Pool:simulateCreate` (or respectevly `Pool:simulateRedeem`) may revert at the slippage check due to reserve amount, less than the minimum amount expected by the user.

NOTE: by higher fee % (capped at 10%) or for longer periods this effect is stronger and reserves may approach 0. Additionally, the reserve pool is also key part of the Auction concept. The coupling of the reserve pool with multiple, competing mechanisms initiated by external calls(auctions and redemptions) without sufficient isolation or prioritization exposes the reserve pool to further depletion risks.

### Impact

As per protocol`s documentation - "...Programmable derivatives are **always** redeemable for some portion of the vault assets, therefore unique structures inherit the liquidity of the vault asset....With ETH-based programmable derivatives, the liquidity of the structure is **only limited** by the liquidity of spot ETH, since all tokenized structures on ETH are redeemable back for ETH".
The reserve pool is the central repository for fulfilling redemptions, yet it's also used for auctions or fee deductions. These competing functions introduce resource contention, where a mechanism like the claiming the fee at random times, can deplete a large portion of the pool, making it unable to meet redemption obligations, thus not corresponding to the "_only limitation_" - **the liquidity of spot ETH**.
Redemption amounts depend on fluctuating parameters such as the reserve pool balance, token supplies, and external oracle prices. Non-sequential fee collection creates a non-deterministic user experience, where identical actions at different times yield different outcomes:
- Early redeemers receive higher payouts if the pool is full,
- Late redeemers suffer if fees significantly deplete the pool,
thus users may view this as unfair, leading to erosion of trust in the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce periodic fee claims, known to the users, to ensure `lastFeeClaimTime` remains updated.
OR
Introduce a maximum fee deduction per `Pool:simulateCreate/Redeem` call to prevent excessive reductions.
