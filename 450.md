# Leverage user can avoid paying fees to bond holders by withdrawing before auction ends

### Summary

Bond holders are paid fees by leverage holders in discrete quarterly payments. Due to the long length of this period, leverage holders can easily exploit and avoid this fee by withdrawing before funds are taken to pay for the auction. By doing this they can easily avoid paying all fees to bond holders, causing substantial losses to other leverage holders who are now forced to pay the malicious user's share of the fees.

[Pool.sol#L511-L517](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L511-L517)

        if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
            redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
        } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
    @>      redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
        } else {
            redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
        }

We see above that the redeemRate for leverage tokens is calculated based on the number of asset held by the pool.

[Pool.sol#L577-L583](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L577-L583)

        function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
            (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
            address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod];
            require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
            
    @>      IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
        }

We also see that funds are transferred out of the contract until after the auction is completed. Therefore if the user withdraws before the auction ends then they will received an amount that is not subject to the bond holders fee.

### Root Cause

[Pool.sol#L383-L414](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L383-L414) fails to enforce or charge partial fees to redeeming leverage users

### Internal preconditions

None

### External preconditions

None

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Leverage users can get leverage exposure for free while forcing other users to pay their fees

### POC

Unfortunately it is impossible to demonstrate via POC because `transferReserveToAuction` is broken

### Mitigation
