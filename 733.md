# when auction failed because of sell pool limit, there is no way to distribute coupons of that period

## Description

During the auction, if totalSellReserveAmount crosses pool limit, that means auction will fail

Auction failed , means pool contract , will not have coupon token to disctribute to the bond holders, for that distribution period. 
Now as per the docs, if pool reserve is not sufficient, then protocol will wait till price of reserve token increases. And after that, they will distribute coupon tokens to bond holders from that increase reserve pool.

But problem is that,there is no way to distribute, coupon token for this particular distribution period. Suppose price of reserve token increases in current distribution period, then protocol will not be able to start auction again in this period. Due to this require check in startAuction()

Now suppode , if price increases in next distribution period, protocol can double the share per token amount, with the intention, that bond holdes, who did not able to claim, for last distribution period, they will claim share per token amount of last distribution included in this distributuion period. But the problem is that, user will be able to claim, share per token amount of last distribution + current distribution's share per token  , which is doubled amount, so ultimately 3x amount. Due to non updates, in the previousPoolAmount struct.

## Impact 

Bond token holder will not get, coupon token for distribution period in which aucion is failed due to pool sell limit

## Mitigation

protocol should figure out the way, to distribute coupon tokens for the period , in which auciton is failed due to pool sell limit.
