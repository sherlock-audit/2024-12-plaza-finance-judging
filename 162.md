# Malicious users can make the auction failed by exploiting the condition of  sale limit of  pool eth balance.

### Summary

Malicious users can place bid in such a way which can ensure that the condition - (Sold ETH via auction < 90% of the vault ETH) in `Auction::endAuction()` function is broken causing the bond holders deprived.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341C7-L342C46
In `Auction.sol::endAuction`  when `totalSellReserveAmount ` is equal or crossing sale limit then the auction fails.
```solidity
function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    } 
//This condition can be exploited by malicious users.
 else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. When `sale limit of pool balance/maxbids <= couponAmountToDistribute`

### External Pre-conditions
1) When price of ETH is falling

### Attack Path

1. Attacker can place bids in such a way that it always cross sale limit. 
2. When the auction period ends, the attacker would call `Auction:endAuction()` and the Auction fails.
3. Then he would claim his usdc calling `Auction::claimRefund()`

### Impact

The bond holders would always deprived of their coupon token.

### PoC

Scenario one: Suppose pool balance is 10,000 eth, sale limit is 9,000 eth. There are 70,000 bond token. Then the we need 175,000 usdc to auction for. if max bid is 1,000 then slot size = 175. The bidders placed their bids and these bids cover more than 175,000 usdc as coupon token and cover around 8,500 eth.
 
The attacker then can place  bid like -  bid(1000 eth, 175,000 usdc). And This would break the condition because 8500+ 100= 9500 which is greater than 9000 eth .
Attacker can make the  bids like bid(500 eth, 175,000 usdc) each to get the bids included.
