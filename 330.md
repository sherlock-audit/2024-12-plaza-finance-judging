# Insufficiant `distribute()` Function.


### Summary
The currently implemented `distribute()` function may provide more coupons than intended or none at all.

### Root Cause
The distribute() function lacks checks to ensure that:
1. No distributions were made before previous periods.
2. The previous period's distributions have already been completed.
3. There is no mechanism to deduct calculated coupons if the auction fails.

```solidity
589:function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
        (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
        require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());

        // Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
        uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
        uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();

        if (Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT ||
            Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD) {

600:        emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
            return;
        }

        // Get Distributor
        address distributor = poolFactory.distributors(address(this));

        // Transfer coupon tokens to the distributor

        IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(distributor, couponAmountToDistribute);
        // Update distributor with the amount to distribute
        Distributor(distributor).allocate(couponAmountToDistribute);

        emit Distributed(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute, distributor);
    }
```

### PoC
1. If no one calls the `distribute()` function in the current period, coupons will not be supplied to bondETH owners and will remain locked in this contract.
2. Calling this function multiple times may result in multiple coupon distributions for the previous period if coupons exist.
3. Coupons are calculated and added at the start of the auction, but this function does not deduct them when the auction fails.
```solidity
Pool.sol
    function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
        ...
        // Increase the bond token period
567:    bondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(sharesPerToken);

        // Update last distribution time
        lastDistribution = block.timestamp;
  }
```

### Impact
Users who claim coupons later may not receive them even if they were distributed first.

### Mitigation
Consider adding a feature to check whether an allocation has been made to the `distributor` for each period.
