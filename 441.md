# Current fee claiming model allows users to force protocol to collect less fee than expected

### Summary

Current claiming fee model allowing fee to be claimed at any time and by anyone, rather than when reserve balance changes, might make protocol to collect less fee than expected. 


### Root Cause

There are two factors, when combining together, will cause the problem:
1. Fee can be claimed at anytime
2. Fee formula depends on the current reserve balance

From these two factors, users will just call to claimFees() while the reserve balance is low (usually after subsequent withdrawals) to make protocol claim less fee.

Consider this example:
Assume fee percentage is 10%
At t1 = 1 year , reserve balance (B1) = 100 WETH
At t2 = 2 year, B2 = 300 WETH
At t3 = 3 year B3 = 100 WETH

Using the above formula to get fee amount, now let's consider some different cases of claiming fee:

Case 1: Only claim fee at t3

Fee amount = `100 WETH * 10% * 3` = 30 WETH

Case 2: Claim fee at t2 and t3

Fee amount  = `300 WETH * 10% * 2`  + `100 WETH * 10% * 1` = 70 WETH

Case 3: Claim fee at t1, t2 and t3

Fee amount  = `100 WETH * 10% * 1` +` 300 WETH * 10% * 1` + `100 WETH * 10% * 1` = 50 WETH

We can easily see that the amount of fee claimed is different depending on when claimFees() is called.


Most other defi protocols avoid this problem by charging fee whenever the reserve balance changes (before deposit, before withdraw, etc ..), so the amount of fee claimed will be the same regardless how many time claimFees() is called manually.
