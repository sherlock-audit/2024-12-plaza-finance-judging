# Fee-on-Transfer tokens like USDC token will cause users to lose funds.

### Summary

Latter Users claiming their coupons in `Distributor.sol` and in `Auction.sol` will be at a loss, the users receiving the bond tokens will be less than what they expect if they claim a refund, if a fee-on-transfer token like USDC is used.

### Root Cause

According to the contest Readme 
`If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of weird tokens you want to integrate?

Standard ERC20. Tokens allowed are set by governance. We will initially use tokens like WETH, USDC, wstETH, WBTC, cbBTC.`

In `Auction.sol` users can buy the BondToken against the USDC which will then be distributed to the users as coupon tokens against their shares. In `Distributor.sol` users can claim this USDC through `claim` function. 
The functions in these contracts assume tokens were transferred but this does not hold true for some non-standard ERC20 tokens, like fee-on-transfer tokens or rebalancing tokens, For example, if a token incurs a fee on transfer, the actual transferred amount will be less than the provided parameter amount and the deposits will have a wrong state value. As users claim or bid, the tokens they receive will be less than what users expect.
