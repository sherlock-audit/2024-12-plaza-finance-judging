# Protocol fee loss


### Summary
The protocol may lose significant amounts of fees.

### Root Cause
The protocol only considers the current balance of reserveToken when calculating fees.
However, since the balance is a constantly changing value, the fee calculation is not accurate.

```solidity
Pool.sol
    function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
719:    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
    }
    function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
        require(msg.sender == feeBeneficiary || poolFactory.hasRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE(), msg.sender), NotBeneficiary());
        uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();
        
        if (feeAmount == 0) {
            revert NoFeesToClaim();
        }
        
708:    lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
        
        emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
    }
```  

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path
In the current implementation, it is advantageous for the protocol to collect and claim fees after a long period of time.
So the fee claimer collects a significant amount of fees without claiming them.
At this time, a user with a significant amount of bondToken withdraws the funds.
After that, if the fee claimer claims the fee, a significant amount of funds are lost.

### PoC
Assuming:
fee = 100000 (10%)
Time1 = lastFeeClaimTime + SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 4, reserveAmount1 = 200e18
Time2 = lastFeeClaimTime + SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 400 + SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 4, reserveAmunt2 = 100e18.

Case 1: Claim Fees at Time2
    earnedfee = 100e18 * 100000 * (SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 400 + SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 4) / (1000000 * SECONDS_PER_YEAR) = 2.525e18;
Case 2: Claim Fees at Time1 and then Time2
    First Claim at Time1:
        feeAmount1 = 200e18 * 100000 * (SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 4) / (1000000 * SECONDS_PER_YEAR) = 5e18;
    Second Claim at Time2:
        feeAmount2 = 100e18 * 100000 * (SECONDS_PER_YEAR / 400) / (1000000 * SECONDS_PER_YEAR) = 0.025e18;
    originalfee = feeAmount1 + feeAmount2 = 7.5e18; 
In this scenario, earnedfee (2.525e18) is less than originalfee (5.025e18) by 2.5e18. 

As a result, protocol may lose 2.5e18 reserveTokens.

### Impact
The protocol may lose significant amounts of fees.

### Mitigation
Consider using accumulated balances for fee calculations.
