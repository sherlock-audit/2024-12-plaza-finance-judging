# [M-1] BondOracleAdapter could be created to monitor the current instant price of bondETH which will break redeem logic

### Summary

As there is no restriction to what the TWAP calculation interval should be in the BondOracleAdapter it could be initialized to get the current price of the bond token. This would mean that the TWAP interval would be zero. This will cause a division by zero revert when we try to fetch the price(market rate) of the bond token and make any kind of redeem from the pool impossible.


### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that we have no protection or checks when we create the ```BondOracleAdapter``` with a value of ```0```  for the ```twapInterval``` parameter. (Note that this a possible scenario as we take the balancer pool  market rate for the bondETH only if it is lower than the calulated ```redeemRate``` which makes it safer to attacks on the balancer pool with a flash loan for example):

We can later see in the ```latestRoundData()```  method which we use to calculate the market rate of the bondETH token we we divide the differences of the tickCumulatives for that period by the ```twapInterval``` which will result in a divison by zero revert

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L99-L114

We fetch this price in our redeem logic in the ```Pool.sol``` contract by using the ```OracleReader.sol``` method ```getOraclePrice()```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A ```BondOracleAdapter``` is created  that has a ```twapInterval``` set to ```0```
2. The oracle needs to be added to the priceFeeds mapping using the ```setPriceFeed``` method that is part of the ```OracleFeeds.sol``` contract, with ```tokenA``` being the bondETH and ```tokenB``` being USD(zero address in our case)

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A ```BondOracleAdapter``` is created  that has a ```twapInterval``` set to ```0```
2. The oracle needs to be added to the priceFeeds mapping using the ```setPriceFeed``` method that is part of the ```OracleFeeds.sol``` contract, with ```tokenA``` being the bondETH and ```tokenB``` being USD(zero address in our case)
3. User mint bondETH and levETH tokens using the ```create()``` function in the ```Pool.sol``` contract
4. Someone that is a holder of any of the two pool tokens tries to redeem their tokens in exchange for the reserve tokens. This would cause a revert.

### Impact

Users are unable to redeem bondETH or levETH tokens which would mean the reserve token they invested in exchange for the pool tokens is stuck inside of the Pool contract.

### PoC

Inside of the ```BondOracleAdapter.t.sol``` file change the value of the following variable to zero

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/test/BondOracleAdapter.t.sol#L23

And run the following PoC test:

```solidity
  function test_PoCLatestRoundDataRevertsOnZeroTWAPInterval() public {
    // Mock observe call on pool
    int56[] memory tickCumulatives = new int56[](2);
    //When we get the current price we need different logic, if we keep the same logic then the tickCumulatives would be the same
    tickCumulatives[0] = 100000;
    tickCumulatives[1] = 100000;
    uint160[] memory secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s = new uint160[](2);

    vm.mockCall(
      dexPool,
      abi.encodeWithSelector(ICLPoolDerivedState.observe.selector),
      abi.encode(tickCumulatives, secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s)
    );

    //Getting the price reverts as we have a divison by zero due to the twap interval
    vm.expectRevert();
    (,int256 answer,,,) = adapter.latestRoundData();
  }
```

### Mitigation

Add a check in the ```initialize``` for the ```BondOracleAdaper.sol``` contract to make sure the contract is not initialized with a zero value of the twap interval

```solidity
require(_twapInterval >0, "Invalid TWAP interval");
```

Or add custom logic to handle when we want to get the instant current price of the bondETH token.
