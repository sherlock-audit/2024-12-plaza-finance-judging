# Higher fee charged & leverage tokens minted when pool created in a paused state

## Description
When a [pool is created via the PreDeposit route](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L154) it's always created by default in a paused state:
```js
    // @audit-info : last param is `true` which results in the pool created in paused state
    pool = factory.createPool(params, reserveAmount, bondAmount, leverageAmount, bondName, bondSymbol, leverageName, leverageSymbol, true);  
```
**Note** that even in the non-PreDeposit route, pool creator has the option to create it in a paused state.

[simulateCreate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L273) and [simulateRedeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433) calculate fee based on the time elapsed since `lastFeeClaimTime`:
```js
    poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
```

But the logic in `Pool.sol` initializes [`lastFeeClaimTime` to the pool creation time](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L164) instead of the time it is **first unpaused** in such cases. Hence the protocol would inadvertently mint higher than intended leverage tokens for the first few users calling `create()`. These users hence benefit more than others for the same amount of their investment. 

This happens so because the [`poolReserves` amount passed to `getCreateAmount()` to would be lower](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L289) resulting in a [lower tvl calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L325). This reduces the [`adjustedValue` and `creationRate` calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L339-L340). Finally this reduced `creationRate` results in the user receiving more tokens since `creationRate` is [in the denominator here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L343):
```js
    return ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
```

The subsequent users would keep on benefitting the same way as the first one since fee is simply based on `(block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)` and `poolReserves` continue to be reduced more than intended **_until claimFees() is called once by admin_** which [resets `lastFeeClaimTime` to current `block.timestamp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L708).

## Impact
- Protocol pockets more than intended fee and also mints higher amount of leverage tokens to the users calling `create()`.
- A reduced `tvl` can cause the protocol to falsely believe that `CL <= threshold` and hence offer creation of tokens [at a discounted rate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L326-L333) thus causing further damage to the protocol.

## Mitigation 
Add a flag which tracks if the pool has been unpaused for the first time since it was created in a paused state. If so, then set `lastFeeClaimTime` to this `block.timestamp`.
