# Incosistency between Eth amount before and after auction leads to unfair leverage, reserves decrese

### Summary

The issue occurs because of maximum amount of eth to distribute while auction is not fixed while auction creation, but clarified while this check in Auction.sol endAuction()
```solidity
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
```
This means, we don't care whatever amount of ETH was in Pool before auction, the maximum amount we sold will be determined with balanceOf() pool in time where auction end.
 
Why this bad choice?

Auction created with purpose to distribute USDC to bond holder, which holds Bonds right before the block before auction created. This exactly means that only ETH held by the block of auction creation should be sold.

At what point it harms users?

consider the following scenario:
user Bob bought 100 bonds and put 10 eth to reserves for them. He hold these bonds until auction creation. (for simplicity assume Bob only holder in a pool).
Auction created
User Alice bought 1000 bonds and put 100 eth to reserves for them. He not elegible for this reward distribution, he hold it until next.
Auction ended up selling 50 eth, because it check balance after auction.

In next distribution pool will miss this 40 eth extra eth to distribute.
Now leverage tokens holders entered after auction start will experience significant lose.

 

### Root Cause

pool.sol startAuction() not track amount of reserves before auction and as a result it relies on state of balance after it
