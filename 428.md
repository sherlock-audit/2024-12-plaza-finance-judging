# Due to rounding down in `Auction::slotSize`  the auction might not be able to sell, even if all of the slots get filled

### Summary

When an auction is started the amount of coupon tokens needed are calculated as  `BondToken::totalSupply * sharesPerToken` in order to distribute even amount for the holders on that period.

The auctions allow users only to deposit in slots and one slots is `totalCoupouNeeded / maxBids`, in our case maxBids is 1000.


The way the Auction verifies that the users are depositing in slots is by checking if `amount % slot == 0`.

```solidity
  function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount)
        external
        auctionActive
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (sellCouponAmount == 0 || sellCouponAmount > totalBuyCouponAmount) revert InvalidSellAmount();

        if (sellCouponAmount % slotSize() != 0) revert InvalidSellAmount();
        if (buyReserveAmount == 0) revert BidAmountTooLow();
        if (buyReserveAmount > MAX_BID_AMOUNT) revert BidAmountTooHigh();
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sellCouponAmount);

        Bid memory newBid = Bid({
            bidder: msg.sender,
            buyReserveAmount: buyReserveAmount,
            sellCouponAmount: sellCouponAmount,
            nextBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the end of the list
            prevBidIndex: 0, // Default to 0, which indicates the start of the list
            claimed: false
        });

        lastBidIndex++; // Avoids 0 index
        uint256 newBidIndex = lastBidIndex;
        bids[newBidIndex] = newBid;
        bidCount++;

        // Insert the new bid into the sorted linked list
        insertSortedBid(newBidIndex);
        currentCouponAmount += sellCouponAmount;
        totalSellReserveAmount += buyReserveAmount;

        if (bidCount > maxBids) {
            if (lowestBidIndex == newBidIndex) {
                revert BidAmountTooLow();
            }
            _removeBid(lowestBidIndex);
        }

        // Remove and refund out of range bids
        removeExcessBids();

        // Check if the new bid is still on the map after removeBids
        if (bids[newBidIndex].bidder == address(0)) {
            revert BidAmountTooLow();
        }

        emit BidPlaced(newBidIndex, msg.sender, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);

        return newBidIndex;
}
```

Due to these checks above the maximum amount a user can deposit is `maxBids * slotSize`, since `(maxBids  + 1 ) * slotSize` will always be more than `totalBuyCouponAmount`

The only way of the auction getting through is by [Auction::removeExcessBids](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L250-L292), which only removes bids, if the new `total amount + new bid amount` exceeds the needed amount.

### Root Cause

`Pool::startAuction` does not validate that `couponAmountToDistribute % maxBids == 0 `, which causes the slots to not add up to `totalBuyCouponAmount`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `totalCouponAmount / maxBids` rounds down
2. `removeExcessBids` never gets called

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. There are 1111 bond tokens and 2.5 USDC share per token
2. `totalCouponAmount` is `(1111e18 * 2.5e18) / (30e30) = 92583333` calculated in [Pool::startAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L545-L550)
3. `Auction::slotSize` is  `92583333 / 1000` = 92583
4. There a 5 users and every user fills 200 slots `(92583 * 200) * 5 = 92583000` which is less than the amount to distribute
5. No one else bids in the auction, and the auction fails despite all off the slots getting filled

### Impact

Bond holders will not be able to get their premium of coupon tokens and the bidders will not get the reserve tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider auctioning only amounts that pass the condition `couponAmountToDistribute % maxBids == 0 `
