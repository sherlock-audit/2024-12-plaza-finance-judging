# A malicious leverage token holder could manipulate reserve token amount of the pool to prevent auctions from success

### Summary

Whenever a distribution period ends, a portion of reserve tokens of the pool is sold through an auction to provide coupons for bond token holders. When the auction ends, it validates if the amount of reserve tokens being sold exceeds the pool sale limit.

The mechanism of selling a portion of reserve tokens of the pool gives advantages to bond token holders since they provide them with coupons, but it does not benefit leverage token holders, or actually it gives disadvantage to leverage token holders since it will drop the TVL of the pool which solely decides the price of leverage token.

Thus, a malicious leverage token holder could prevent an auction from success by manipulating the reserve token amount in the pool.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue comes from validation of token amounts being sold depends on the amount as of `endAuction` being cold, which can vary, as implemented in [Auction.sol#L341](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341).

```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();

    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
>   } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- An auction has ended and it's about to success.

### External Pre-conditions

- A malicious user had deposited specific amounts of reserve tokens before the auction starts.

### Attack Path

- Before the auction starts, the pool has `100 ETH` as reserve token, including `10 ETH` that a malicious user has deposited in exchange for leverage token.
- The pool sale limit is set to 10%, which means upto `10 ETH` could be sold during the auction.
- The auction is successfully finished, requiring `9.5 ETH` to be sold in exchange for coupon tokens.
- The malicious user redeems his `10 ETH`, which makes it `90 ETH` remaining in the pool.
- Since 10% limit of the pool is `9 ETH`, the auction eventually fails.
- Because the auction fails, coupon distribution for the period does not work either.

### Impact

- Bond token holders do not receive coupon tokens.
- Leverage token holders take advantage because reserve tokens are not sold, thus increasing TVL.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Rather than determining sale limit of reserve tokens as of `endAuction` is called, it should pre-determine the amount when the auction starts, thus preventing volatility of pool sale limit issue.
