# The fee calculation does not reflect the fluctuation in the fee accrued from the last fee claimed time,

### Summary

This formula tries to calculate a fee based on the amount of money in the pool (poolReserves) since the last time fees were claimed.
It assumes the pool's money hasn't changed since the last fee claim.
It calculates the fee as if the entire balance was constant over the entire period.

""   poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
   ""

### Root Cause

The formula assumes the pool's balance is the same throughout the period. However, in reality, the balance can change frequently as people deposit or withdraw money.
If the pool had more money at certain times and less at others, the fee should reflect these changes. For example, if the pool had more money for a while, the fee should be higher for that period.
Think of it like a savings account where you earn interest. If you had $100 for half the year and $200 for the other half, you'd expect to earn more interest when you had more money and pay more fee. The current formula doesn't account for this kind of change.
As long as the formula assumes a constant balance, it will not accurately reflect the true fees that should be accrued based on fluctuating balances.
This means the calculated fee might be too high or too low, depending on how the balance actually changed over time.
