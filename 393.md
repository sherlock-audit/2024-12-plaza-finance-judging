# Loss of precision leads to invariant violation

### Summary

If a user attempts to redeem leveraged tokens when the amount of non-reserved tvl is smaller than the total number of leverage tokens, the user will get zero tokens, in violation of the invariant:
```text
Q: What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?
Redemption of leverage token shouldn't be zero as long as there are bonds issued. Market should have started at a non-zero state. Exception of rounding issues on extremely low values of leverage token.
```

### Root Cause

The calculation of the [`redeemRate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L514) does a multiplication on the result of a division, so the attempt to increase precision has no effect:

```solidity
      redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
...
  return ((depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) / ethPrice) / PRECISION;
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The value available to the holders of leverage tokens must be smaller than the total leverage token supply 

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. User calls `redeem()` for their leveraged tokens, and gets zero

### Impact

The invariant mentioned in the README is violated. 

### PoC

Note that the amount redeemed is not limited to dust amounts. Consider the case where a single holder of the leverage tokens holds 100% of the supply (or a large value), where the total supply of the leverage token is 100 eth, worth 99 eth. Because of the loss of precision, their `depositAmount` will be multiplied by zero, even though they should be entitled to 99 eth instead.

### Mitigation

```diff
-      redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
+      redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / assetSupply;
```
