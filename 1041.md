# Skipping the startAuction for one time will leave Users unable to start the subsequent ones

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530-L535

We see that the Auction starts within a specified interval, once this interval passes and the User did not call it during the time.
The `lastDistribution ` is not updated anymore 

Though this is rare, it shouldn't leave the protocol bricked and the only way to unlock is to put distribution period to a hacky value.
