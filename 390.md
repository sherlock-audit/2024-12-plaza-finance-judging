# lToken Not Considered in MarketRate

### Summary

`Pool::getRedeemAmount` calculates the amount of reserve tokens to be redeemed for a given amount of bond or leverage tokens.

It is expected that when the market price (marketRate) is lower than the calculated redeemRate, the marketRate should be used as the reference price for redemption. However, only the marketRate of the bondToken is considered.

### Root Cause

According to the whitepaper, the price of the lToken at the time of redemption should be compared with the market price, but this never happens.

This allows users to buy lTokens at a lower market price and redeem them in the pool for a higher amount of underlying tokens, creating an arbitrage opportunity that could drain the protocol's collateral.
