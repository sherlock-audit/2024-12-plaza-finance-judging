# A malicious depositor can manipulate the initial collateral level of pools

### Summary

`PreDeposit` contract allows users to deposit reserve tokens that will be used as initial supply of pools.
The owner of `PreDeposit` contract sets initial `bondAmount` and `leverageAmount` through `setBondAndLeverageAmount` function which can only be called before the deposit period ends.

This access control mechanism exposes an issue where a malicious depositor could withdraw the assets right before the deposit period ends to manipulate initial collateral ratio.

### Root Cause

The root cause is because on the line [PreDeposit.sol#L153-154](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L153-L154), it creates pool with deposited amount of reserve tokens without validation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The owner sets bond amount and leverage amount during the deposit period.
- The deposit period is about to end.

### External Pre-conditions

- A malicious user had deposited reserve tokens to the `PreDeposit` contract.

### Attack Path

- A `PreDeposit` contract is created, `depositCap` is set to `1 ETH = 3000 USDC`.
- A malicious user deposits `0.5 ETH`.
- The owner expects that `1 ETH` should be filled, and set appropriate bond and leverage amount, potentially to `20 BondToken + 10 LeverageToken`, assuming the `collateralLevel` to be greater than 1.2 after initialization.
- Right before the deposit period ends, the malicious depositor withdraws his `0.5 ETH` from the contract, which leaves only `0.5 ETH` in the contract.
- A pool is created by calling `createPool` which will create a pool with `0.5 ETH` and `20 BondToken + 10 LeverageToken`.
- After initialzation, the `collateralLevel` becomes `0.75`.

### Impact

The attacker can manipulate the initial collateral level, downgrading the collateral level under 1.2 and discentivizes bond creation in general.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

There might be a few different mitigations based on the protocol design, including:

1. Since owner role is trusted, allow the owner to modify bond and leverage amount after the deposit period ends, and only let owner to call `createPool`.
2. When `createPool` is called, it only creates pools when the deposit cap is met.
