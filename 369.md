# Automatic pool selection in BondOracleAdapter may cause it to report an incorrect price

### Summary

The code selects the first existing pool by iterating over tick spacing from lowest to highest, which ensures only that the tick spacing is minimal. However, this does not guarantee sufficient liquidity and trading activity in the pool to ensure the correct functioning of the oracle.

### Root Cause

In the `BondOracleAdapter:getPool()`, it iterates over an array of spacing and returns the first existing pool:

As can be seen in the `initialize()`, this is how the pool is determined during contract initialization:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L60

This pool will be used as a source of the price reporting done inside `latestRoundData()`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L107

Therefore, if multiple pools exist and the one with the most liquidity - where the majority of trades occur - is not the one with the lowest tick spacing, the pool with the lowest tick spacing may be used to report a stale price and could make oracle susceptible to price manipulation due to low liquidity.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

1. Multiple pools exist for bondToken/liquidityToken pair.
2. A pool that has the most liquidity and trading volume is not the one that BondOracleAdapter is pointed to.

### Attack Path

#### Example 1.
1. The protocol team creates a bondETH/liquidityToken pool with `tickSpacing = 50` and funds initial liquidity.
2. Someone creates a pool for the same pair with `tickSpacing = 1`.
3. The protocol team deploys BondOracleAdapter which results in being pointed to a pool with `tickSpacing = 1`.
4. BondOracleAdapter reports stale/incorrect prices from the pool with `tickSpacing = 1`.

#### Example 2.
1. The protocol team creates a bondETH/liquidityToken pool with `tickSpacing = 1` and funds initial liquidity.
2. Someone creates a pool for the same pair with `tickSpacing = 50`.
3. The protocol team deploys BondOracleAdapter which results in being pointed to a pool with `tickSpacing = 1`. This is fine at this point.
4. For whatever reason, trading activity and liquidity have shifted to a pool with `tickSpacing = 50`.
5. The protocol team re-deploys BondOracleAdapter but it always ends up pointing to the pool with `tickSpacing = 1`. This is impossible to avoid without fixing the root cause in the code.

### Impact

* Incorrect price reporting may cause underpricing or overpricing of bond token in case of stale price or intentional price manipulations which in turn will result in losses for users or the protocol.
* Redeployment of the BondOracleAdapter contract will not help in most cases as it is designed to select the pool with the lowest tick spacing only.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Abandon automatic pool selection during the contract initialization and simply pass the pool address as an input argument.
