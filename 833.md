# Coupon token distribution to bond holders can be repeated multiple times for a previous elapsed period

### Summary

Coupon token distribution to bond holders can be repeated multiple times for an elapsed period leading to contract drain or premature coupon distribution.

### Root Cause

[Pool::distribute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589-L614) is called to distribute coupon tokens to bond token holders after distribution period is passed:

```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Distributes coupon tokens to bond token holders.
   * Can only be called after the distribution period has passed.
   */
  function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());

    // Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();

    if (Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT ||
        Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD) {

      emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
      return;
    }

    // Get Distributor
    address distributor = poolFactory.distributors(address(this));

    // Transfer coupon tokens to the distributor
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(distributor, couponAmountToDistribute);

    // Update distributor with the amount to distribute
    Distributor(distributor).allocate(couponAmountToDistribute);

    emit Distributed(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute, distributor);
  }
```

If the previous auction state is successful, coupon tokens are distributed to bond token holders.

During a call to this function, the `totalBuyCouponAmount` of the previous auction is distributed - but no checks are in place to ensure that this period's rewards have already been distributed. This can be used to prematurely distributed the current unfinished period's rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A newly entered period, making it possible to distribute the previous period's rewards.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Period `x` elapses with `1e18` distribution coupon tokens available, and a new period `y` already started.
2. The contract has a balance of `>= 2e18` distribution tokens.
3. A malicious user can simply call `distribute()` as many times as needed to empty the contract balance including stealing the current periods distribution tokens that should be distributed when a new period begins.

### Impact

Loss of contract distribution rewards / theft of reward token balance / over distribution of rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure the individual period reward distributions are tracked and revert if already called for the last period.
