# Unnecessary precision loss will cause a slightly lower reserveReduction

### Summary

Due to division before multiplication in:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L281

The result will be a lower reserveReduction value than expected, essentially meaning that the totalSellReserveAmout gets reduced less than it should, so the person getting their bid removed actually receives more of the reserve per token than they should have otherwise received. 

### Root Cause

Division before multiplication results in unnecessary precision loss. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Whenever `Auction::removeExcessBids` is called, it is highly likely that there will be some minor unnecessary precision loss. 

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

Tested in remix
```
function currentTest() public pure returns(uint, uint) {
        // current2StepResult = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * proportion) / 1e18) = ((currentBid.buyReserveAmount * (amountToRemove * 1e18) / sellCouponAmount) / 1e18)
        uint current2StepResult = uint(100e18) * (uint(800000) * uint(1e18) / uint(9e18)) / uint(1e18);
        uint alternative = uint(100e18) * uint(800000) * uint(1e18) / (uint(9e18) * uint(1e18));
        return (current2StepResult, alternative);
    }
```
The outcomes are:
```
0:
uint256: 8888800
1:
uint256: 8888888
```
As you can see, there is unnecessary precision loss incurred in the current implementation of the code relative to the alternative scenario that could be taking place id all multiplication took place before division.
