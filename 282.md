# Issue with checks in distribute() function


## Summary 

An issue has been identified in the Pool contract's distribute() function, which lacks proper time checks. Despite the function comment stating it "Can only be called after the distribution period has passed", no such check exists. This allows any external actor to trigger distributions at any time, disrupting the protocol's intended token distribution mechanism.

## Vulnerability Details
The problem exists in the distribute() function:

```solidity
function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());

    // Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();
    
    // ... rest of function
}
```

Key issues:

Despite the function comment claiming distribution period validation, no such check exists.
The function is marked as external with minimal access controls.
The function should have checks to be called after the distribution period has passed, but there isn't such. 

## Impact

Financial Impact:

Abused distribution of coupon tokens
Manipulation of distribution timing


I mark this as a high vulnerability because: It directly impacts protocol assets and core functionality.
