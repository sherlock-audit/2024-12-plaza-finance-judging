# Unable to Create Pool Due to Missing POOL_ROLE Authorization in PreDeposit Contract

### Summary

The `PreDeposit.sol` contract's createPool() function cannot execute successfully because the contract is never granted the POOL_ROLE required by the PoolFactory contract. This effectively breaks the core functionality of the protocol, preventing any pool creation through the PreDeposit mechanism.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization step in the contract setup. The PreDeposit contract's createPool() function calls PoolFactory's createPool(), which is protected by the POOL_ROLE modifier:
In PoolFactory.sol:

```solidity
function createPool(...) external whenNotPaused() onlyRole(POOL_ROLE) returns (address) {}
```

In PreDeposit.sol:

```solidity
function createPool() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused checkDepositEnded {
    if (reserveAmount == 0) revert NoReserveAmount();
    if (bondAmount == 0 || leverageAmount == 0) revert InvalidBondOrLeverageAmount();
    if (poolCreated) revert PoolAlreadyCreated();
    IERC20(params.reserveToken).approve(address(factory), reserveAmount);
    pool = factory.createPool(params, reserveAmount, bondAmount, leverageAmount, bondName, bondSymbol, leverageName, leverageSymbol, true);
    // ...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Nowhere there is any code that grants the PreDeposit contract the required POOL_ROLE. This means that any attempt to call createPool() from the PreDeposit contract will revert due to the role check in PoolFactory.



### Impact

Users can deposit funds into the PreDeposit contract but the contract cannot progress to pool creation.
Impact: High - The vulnerability completely breaks the core functionality of the protocol 

### PoC


The issue is evident from the existing code, as the createPool() function in PoolFactory.sol is protected by the onlyRole(POOL_ROLE) modifier, but the PreDeposit contract is never granted this role, leading to the failure of pool creation.
