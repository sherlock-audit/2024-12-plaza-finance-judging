# Malicious bidder can get blacklisted to prevent other users from bidding

### Summary

The intended operation mode of Auction contract is that bidders can bid until maxBids is reached. After that, new bids must be higher than the lowest bid at the moment so that new bid is inserted and the lowest bid is removed with _removeBid(), always keeping a number of bids equal to maxBids.
However, a malicious user can make a low bid at the beginning of the auction (making sure that it will be removed when highest bids come) and then get their account blacklisted preventing new bidders from bidding when maxBids is reached.

### Root Cause

When a user calls bid(), they send their bidding amount of couponToken (USDC) to Auction contract. If a bid is to be removed to make place for a new one, the sent couponTokens will be returned to the bidder as that bid is no longer taken into account in the protocol (line 325).

USDC token implements a blacklist, which prevents blacklisted users from making any operations with USDC token (even receiving them). Malicious bidder can behave badly on purpose after they have submitted their low bid to get blacklisted. After that if their bid is tried to be removed the function will revert when trying to send couponToken (USDC token) to the blacklisted user. Auctions are expected to last 10 days, which is such a considerable time to receive a large amount of bids.

### Attack Path

1. A new Auction starts and malicious user makes a low bid, ensuring that at any point it will be replaced by higher bids.
2. Malicious user behaves badly on purpose to get their address blacklisted for USDC (Circle docs indicate that certain actions can lead to getting an address blacklisted, so that this is totally feasible).
3. maxBids amount is reached so that new bids should replace lowest bids.
4. The bid made by malicious user cannot be replaced as bid() function reverts when trying to send USDC back to the bidder, new bids cannot be made.

### Impact

Auctions will not function as it should as highest bids cannot replace lowest ones, this breaks the intended operation mode of the system and will probably lead to Auction being FAILED for not reaching totalBuyCouponAmount. Although there are not loss of funds for users the expected behaviour the contract is broken.


### Mitigation

When a bid is to be removed with _removeBid(), set a variable that allows bidder to claim USDC of removed bid instead of sending them back, this way the blacklisting only affects malicious user if they try to claim and not the rest of the contract.

Another solution can be to use a try/catch so that a blacklisted user is bypassed when USDC tokens are sent to them instead of reverting the function.
