# getOraclePrice will disrupt Protocol functionality on Base Mainnet due to USD-based price feed reliance

### Summary

The Pool contract [inherists](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/ab5bbd7d54042e4444b711a32def5b639fbd63b4/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L25) from OracleReader and uses the [`getOraclePrice()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/ab5bbd7d54042e4444b711a32def5b639fbd63b4/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L55-L75) to get the price of a reserve asset.

The Plaza protocol currently relies on USD-based price feeds for LSTs. However, Base Mainnet typically provides only `LST/ETH` price feeds e.g [wstETH](https://data.chain.link/feeds/base/base/wsteth-eth), making the current implementation incompatible with the mainnet environment. Without pre-deployment adjustments, this discrepancy could lead to significant disruptions, including the inability to process creations and redemptions or inaccurate pricing.

In function **`Pool::simulateCreate`** we call **`Pool::getCreateAmount`**, the protocol directly queries the price of reserveToken (e.g., wstETH) against USD:
```solidity
function simulateCreate(TokenType tokenType, uint256 depositAmount) public view returns(uint256) {

//...

 return getCreateAmount(
      tokenType,
      depositAmount,
      bondSupply,
      levSupply,
      poolReserves,
 >    getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD),
      getOracleDecimals(reserveToken, USD)
    ).normalizeAmount(COMMON_DECIMALS, assetDecimals);
  }
```

This approach is functional on Base Testnet due to the use of the [MockPiceFeed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/ab5bbd7d54042e4444b711a32def5b639fbd63b4/plaza-evm/test/mocks/MockPriceFeed.sol#L6) but fails to account for the lack of LST/USD price feeds on Base Mainnet. Instead, mainnet provides `LST/ETH` feeds, requiring the protocol to derive `LST/USD` prices by combining `LST/ETH` and [`ETH/USD`](https://data.chain.link/feeds/base/base/eth-usd) feeds.

There is 2 scenarios, and each one them will relly on [`getOraclePrice()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/ab5bbd7d54042e4444b711a32def5b639fbd63b4/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L55-L75) at some point, and this always cause an issue in mainnet, because of the current logic of `getOraclePrice()`.

- Scenario 1 : Reserve Token as e.g wstETH
getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD) is called and the problem is wstETH/USD, doesn't exist.

- Scenario 2 : Reserve Token as a Balancer LP
In this case the price feed will be [BalancerOracleAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol#L18), and inside `getOraclePrice` function :
```solidity
 function getOraclePrice(address quote, address base) public view returns(uint256) {

 // . . . 

    }
  >  (,int256 answer,,uint256 updatedTimestamp,) = AggregatorV3Interface(feed).latestRoundData();
    
// . . .
  }
```
This calls [`BalancerOracleAdapter::latestRoundData()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol#L95-L118), where `getOraclePrice(address(tokens[i]), USD)` is invoked. However, Balancer pools typically contain LST/RSTs as the sponsor confirmed, for which `LST/USD` feeds do not exist, resulting in failure.

### Root Cause

The reliance on `getOraclePrice()` assumes the availability of LST/USD price feeds, which most of the them are not provided on Base Mainnet.

### Likelihood

HIGH 

### Impact

HIGH : Disrupted price feed functionality that causes failure in derivative creation and redemption.

### Mitigation

To ensure compatibility with Base Mainnet, in `OracleReader::getOraclePrice` derive `LST/USD` prices using the following formula:
```shell
LST/USD = (LST/ETH) * (ETH/USD)
```
