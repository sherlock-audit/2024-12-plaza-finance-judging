# if share per token is ever changed, it could cause a mismatch of state

### Summary

if the sharePerToken is changed in pool, there will either be a deficit or an excess in tokens required and expected by the auction contract because the tokens required depend on the globalool.sharePerToken in the Bond contract while the token expected depends on the sharePerToken in the pool contract

### Root Cause

When an auction for a period is created, it uses the shares per token stored in the Pool contract to determine how many tokens it is to receive , but when the state is stored in the bond token contract, it uses the last globalPool.shares per token 

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

There will a deficit of tokens between what is owed to users and what is gotten from the auction 

### PoC

assuming a constant token supply of 1000 tokens for simplicity 
 at period x - 1 
 the sharePerToken in the pool contract = 20
the current glocbalPool.sharePerToken = 20 
auction is created for x - 1 
this increases the current period to x and sets to glocbalPool.sharePerToken to 20 

before an auction is created for x,  the sharePerToken in the pool contract is changed to 10 
when an auction is created for x, it will use the current sharePerToken in the pool contract so it will try to get 1000 * 10 tokens from the auction 

when the state is updated in the bondtoken for period x , it uses the stored glocbalPool.sharePerToken which is still 20 and update the current period to x + 1 
since users can lay claim to all periods before the current one, they can lay claim to their shares on x by transferring the tokens to themselves 
the total owes owed at period x is 1000 * 20 which is greater than the 1000 * 10 tokens that will be gotten from the auction meaning is a deficit of 1000 * 10 tokens

### Mitigation

When creating an auction , used the stored sharepertoken in the bond token contract to determine how many coupon tokens to receive
