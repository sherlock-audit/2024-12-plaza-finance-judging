# Unhandled failed auction lead to coupon amount discrepancy and claim failures

### Summary

A mismatch between the `couponAmountToDistribute` calculation in `Pool.startAuction()` and the accrued shares in `BondToken.increaseIndexedAssetPeriod()` will cause an under-allocation of coupon tokens if a previous auction failed and the next auction succeeds.  As a result, some bond token holders will encounter a `NotEnoughSharesToDistribute` error when attempting to `claim()` their entitled coupons in `Distributor.claim()`.

### Root Cause

The core issue lies in the inconsistent accounting for shares accrued during failed auctions.  `Pool.startAuction()` ([Pool.sol:530](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530)) calculates `couponAmountToDistribute` based on the current period's `totalSupply()` and `sharesPerToken`, but ignores shares accumulated during prior failed auction.  While `Pool.distribute()` ([Pool.sol:589](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589)) correctly avoids distributing coupons for a failed auction, the `increaseIndexedAssetPeriod()` call within `startAuction()` ([Pool.sol:567](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L567)) still accrues these shares to bond token holders. This creates a discrepancy, bond token holder's shares calculated by `BondToken.getIndexedUserAmount()`, include shares from failed auction, while the `couponAmountToDistribute` in the `Distributor` does not account for this period. At a moment, this mismatch leads to a shortfall when bond token holders attempt to claim their coupons.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An auction needs to fail due to either `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` or `FAILED_UNDERSOLD` ([Auction.sol:336](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336)).
2. The next auction must succeed.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1.  The auction fails, meaning `Auction.state` is either `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` or `FAILED_UNDERSOLD`.  `distribute()` emits a `DistributionRollOver` event and returns without distributing any coupon tokens. 
2. However, as `increaseIndexedAssetPeriod()` has been called in `startAuction()`, accruing `shares` for bond token holders even though no coupons were earned for that period.
```solidity
function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }
```
3. A new auction starts and succeeds. `startAuction()` calculates `couponAmountToDistribute` without considering the `couponAmountToDistribute` from the previous failed auction.
4. Bond token holders call `claim()` ([Distributor.sol:78](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L78)). The Distributor calculates their entitlement based on the *total* accrued `sharesPerToken`, which includes the shares from the failed auction. Since `couponAmountToDistribute` is insufficient, a `NotEnoughSharesToDistribute` error will occur, and not all bond token holders will receive their entitled coupons.

### Impact

Not all bond token holders will receive their coupon entitlements after a failed auction followed by a successful auction. This breaks the expected mechanism.

### Mitigation

Modify `startAuction()` to consider the undistributed `sharesPerToken` from any previous failed auctions when calculating `couponAmountToDistribute`.  One approach could be to store the undistributed coupon amounts from failed auctions and add this amount to the `couponAmountToDistribute` calculation of the next auction.  This ensures that sufficient coupons are available for bondholders to claim their full entitlements.
