# Griefing Attack on Pool Initialization

### Summary

The [initialization function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L135C3-L150C23)  of the Pool smart contract enables a critical griefing attack vector by lacking proper initialization safeguards. The contract's unprotected initialization mechanism allows an adversary to deliberately disrupt the pool deployment process by maliciously front-running and manipulating the contract's initial configuration, effectively preventing the legitimate deployment from succeeding or forcing costly redeployments.



### Root Cause

Specific Security Gaps
1. Ownership Initialization Omission
The initialize function critically lacks a proper ownership initialization step. By not calling __Ownable_init(), the contract leaves a significant security gap that prevents establishing clear ownership and administrative control over the contract's critical functions.
2. Access Control Deficiencies
Without proper access control mechanisms, the initialization function becomes a potential attack vector that can be exploited by malicious actors to compromise the entire pool deployment process.
```Solidity
function initialize(
    address _poolFactory,
    uint256 _fee,
    address _reserveToken,
    // ... other params
) initializer public {
    __OracleReader_init(_oracleFeeds);
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    __Pausable_init();
// Missing __Ownable_init() or access control
```

An attacker can:

1. Monitor mempool for Pool deployments
2. Front-run the initialization call
3. Initialize the pool with malicious parameters
4. Force the protocol to redeploy the pool

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Potential Attack Scenario
An attacker can execute a sophisticated attack with the following methodology:

- Mempool Monitoring: Continuously monitor the blockchain's mempool for new Pool contract deployments.
- Front-Running: Intercept the initialization transaction before it is confirmed on the blockchain.
- Malicious Initialization: Execute an alternative initialization call with carefully crafted, harmful parameters.
- Protocol Disruption: Force the protocol to redeploy the pool, potentially causing:
    - Financial losses
    - Operational disruptions
    - Compromise of intended pool configurations

### Impact

Without addressing these vulnerabilities, the Pool contract remains exposed to:

- Unauthorized parameter manipulation
- Potential funds misappropriation
- Compromise of protocol integrity
- Loss of user trust and potential financial damages

The vulnerability underscores the critical importance of comprehensive access control and secure initialization patterns in blockchain smart contract development.

### PoC

```Solidity
function testGriefingAttack() public {
    // 1. Deploy pool via factory
    address poolAddress = factory.deployPool();
    
    // 2. Attacker front-runs initialization
    vm.prank(attacker);
    Pool(poolAddress).initialize(
        attacker,  // malicious poolFactory
        0,         // zero fee
        address(0),// invalid reserve token
        // ... other params
    );
    
    // 3. Original initialization will revert
    vm.expectRevert("Initializable: contract is already initialized");
    Pool(poolAddress).initialize(
        address(factory),
        fee,
        reserveToken,
        // ... other params
    );
}
```

### Mitigation

Immediate Remediation

- Implement __Ownable_init() during contract initialization
- Add access control modifiers (e.g., onlyOwner)
- Restrict initialization to a single, secure transaction
- Implement a robust role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism
```Solidity
function initialize(
    address _poolFactory,
    uint256 _fee,
    address _reserveToken,
    // ... other params
) initializer public {
    // Initialize ownership
    __Ownable_init();
    
    // Existing initializations
    __OracleReader_init(_oracleFeeds);
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    __Pausable_init();
    
    // Additional access control and validation
    require(_poolFactory != address(0), "Invalid pool factory");
    require(_fee > 0, "Invalid fee");
    
    // Set initial state with access controls
    poolFactory = _poolFactory;
    fee = _fee;
    reserveToken = _reserveToken;
}
```
