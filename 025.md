# Incorrect bid sorting causes protocol to accept suboptimal bids, resulting in revenue loss

### Summary

Reversed price comparison logic in bid sorting will cause a loss of revenue for the protocol as bidders offering lower reserve-per-coupon prices will be incorrectly prioritized over higher-priced bids

### Root Cause

In [src/Auction.sol:31](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L239) the price comparison multiplication is reversed, causing the function to compare sellCouponAmount/buyReserveAmount instead of buyReserveAmount/sellCouponAmount

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There needs to be at least one existing bid in the auction that offers a higher reserve-per-coupon price
2. The auction needs to be active (not ended or paused)
3. The bid needs to meet minimum requirements (non-zero buyAmount, valid sellAmount within totalBuyCouponAmount)

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice submits a bid offering 300 reserve tokens for 2000 coupon tokens (price = 0.15 per coupon) 
2. Bob submits a bid offering 100 reserve tokens for 1000 coupon tokens (price = 0.10 per coupon)
3. Due to the reversed sorting logic, Bob's bid is incorrectly placed higher in the order than Alice's bid

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of revenue equal to the difference between the highest and lowest bid prices multiplied by the coupon amount.

### PoC


```solidity
  function testBidSortingOrder() public {
    uint256 sellAmount = 1000000000;  // Match totalBuyCouponAmount from setUp
    
    // Bid 1: 100 ethers for 1000000000 coupon
    address bidder1 = address(0x54);
    vm.startPrank(bidder1);
    usdc.mint(bidder1, 1000 ether);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), sellAmount);
    auction.bid(100 ether, sellAmount);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Bid 2: Higher price (300 ethers for same amount)
    address bidder2 = address(0x55);
    vm.startPrank(bidder2);
    usdc.mint(bidder2, 1000 ether);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), sellAmount);
    auction.bid(300 ether, sellAmount);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Bid 3: Lower price (30 ethers for same amount)
    address bidder3 = address(0x56);
    vm.startPrank(bidder3);
    usdc.mint(bidder3, 1000 ether);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), sellAmount);
    auction.bid(30 ether, sellAmount);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Verify bid order
    (address highestBidder,,,,, ) = auction.bids(auction.highestBidIndex());
    (address lowestBidder,,,,, ) = auction.bids(auction.lowestBidIndex());

    assertEq(highestBidder, bidder2, "Highest bidder should be bidder2");
    assertEq(lowestBidder, bidder3, "Lowest bidder should be bidder3");
}
```
