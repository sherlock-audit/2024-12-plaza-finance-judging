# The remaining deposit BLP will be stuck in `BalancerRouter.sol` when the user makes a deposit to `PreDeposit.sol`

### Summary

Plaza uses Balancer Pool LP (BLP) tokens as the underlying pool asset to allow user to contribute and gain exposure to a variety of underlying pool when creating `bondETH` and `levETH`.  A user may deposit a single asset, which is converted to BLP tokens and automatically deposited in the pool. Deposits can also be made via `PreDeposit.sol` .

The problem arises when users deposit BLP tokens as reserve tokens on `PreDeposit.sol`. The main problem here is because there is no mechanism for refunding excess funds when users deposit BLP tokens in an amount greater than the `reserveCap`.

### Root Cause

*In [BalancerRouter.sol:23-40](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L23-L40) there is missing refund mechanism*

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

1. `reserveAmount + amount â‰¥ reserveCap` when user make a deposit on `PreDeposit.sol`

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. User loss the remaining BLP token he / she use to make deposit on `PreDeposit.sol`

### PoC

```solidity
    function joinBalancerAndPredeposit(
        bytes32 balancerPoolId,
        address _predeposit,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        // Step 1: Join Balancer Pool
31        uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = joinBalancerPool(balancerPoolId, assets, maxAmountsIn, userData);

        // Step 2: Approve balancerPoolToken for PreDeposit
        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(_predeposit, balancerPoolTokenReceived);

        // Step 3: Deposit to PreDeposit
37        PreDeposit(_predeposit).deposit(balancerPoolTokenReceived, msg.sender);

        return balancerPoolTokenReceived;
    }
```

1. Alice call `BalancerRouter::joinBalancerAndPredeposit()` 
2. Assume Alice now have 500 BLP token (line 31 : `balancerPoolTokenReceived = 500 BLP`), but the ownership of this BLP token is the `BalanceRouter.sol` contract. This can be seen in the `joinBalancerPool()` function on line [87](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L86)
3. On line 37, deposit to `PreDeposit.sol` happen. Then, there is a mechanism in [PreDeposit::_deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/PreDeposit.sol#L124-L126) to fulfill the `reserveCap` capacity, if the `deposit amount + current reserveAmount >= reserveCap` then the deposit amount will be `reserveCap - reserveAmount`. And this will be the main problem for Alice when she make a deposit
4. As an example, current `reserveAmount 700 BLP` and `reserveCap 1000 BLP`. If Alice deposit 500 BLP then she only deposit 300 BLP to `PreDeposit.sol` and the remaining 200 BLP she has are stuck in `BalancerRouter.sol`.
