# Potential Fund Locking Issue in ClaimBid Function

### Summary

The `claimBid()` function in the current implementation uses the `transfer` method instead of `safeTransfer` to send tokens to the bidder. This could lead to funds being locked if there are insufficient funds in the contract at the time of calling the function.

### Attack Path

1. Ensure that the contract has less than the required `buyReserveAmount` available.
2. Call the `claimBid()` function with a valid `bidIndex`.
3. Observe that the transaction fails due to insufficient funds.
4. Check the state of the `bidInfo.claimed` flag, which should now be true despite the failed transfer.

### Impact

If the `transfer` fails due to insufficient funds, the `bidInfo.claimed` flag will still be set to `true`, preventing the user from retrying the claim even though the funds were not successfully transferred. This results in the user's funds being effectively locked without them receiving the intended reward.

Manual Review

### Mitigation

Replace the `transfer` method with `safeTransfer` to ensure that the `bidInfo.claimed` flag is only set to true if the token transfer is successful. This prevents users from losing access to their claims due to failed transactions caused by insufficient funds.
