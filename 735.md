# Chainlink price check doesnt return USD value for wstEth in Base Mainnet.

### Summary

The protocol is meant to work with wstEth as one of the pools reserve tokens. When getting the create amount the code is supposed to return the value of the token in USD, but there is no wstETH/USD price feed existing in Base Mainnet. Same when calculating the redeem amount.

### Root Cause

Protocol assumes wstETH/USD chainlink feed exists.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user needs to call [`create`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L205) using wstETH as collateral.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Protocol doesnt support wstETH as reserve token, which is contradictory to the ReadMe.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

Implement code that first converts wstETH into ETH and then check the converted amount of ETH to USD price.
