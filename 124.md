# user Transferring bonds after duration period but before auction, loses coupon payment for that period

### Summary

Users who desire to hold for an entire duration period before transferring, as they wish to get the coupon payment for that period - and then transfer the bonds after the duration period ends will lose the accounting that gives them the right to the coupon payment for that period if they transfer before the auction begins. 

### Root Cause

The accounting of `checkpointing` as outlined in the docs is used to keep track of all users duration periods that they held bonds for to ensure they are entitled to the coupon payments for those periods. The docs also state, that if a user transfers a bond after a duration period, they will still be entitled to the coupon payment for the previous periods they held. 

**FROM THE DOCS**

_Checkpointing is a function that tracks the holdings of each user during specific coupon distribution periods to account for outstanding coupons. It determines which period the asset has been transferred in and tallies up all of the unclaimed coupons for each period. Therefore, there is always a running record of each holder and the distribution period that they have held at._

But the duration period changes only when an auction begins in the `startAuction` function in `Pool.sol`:

The issue is that the docs do not state that `startAuction` will be automatically called by a bot, instead it relies on users to call the function once the period ends, leaving time in between those 2 actions. 

A bond holder who judisciously is aware of the duration period so they can transfer the bonds but still receive payment, will lose the accounting that they had the bonds for that period if they transfer before that auction begins and increases the global period. 


### Attack Path

1. User has 50 bonds for periods 1-3. period 3 duration period ends and the user transfers all 50 of his bonds before the auction begins.
- This will update their accounting in `BondToken.sol` and update their `lastUpdatePeriod` to 3 instead of 4.

The users `shares` balance is updated to equal the total of 2 periods and not 3. Because `currentPeriod` is still 3 and they purchased the bonds at period 1, so `lastUpdatedPeriod` = 1.

2. The auction ends and the user calls `Distributor::claim` expecting to receive coupon payments for all 3 periods, but only has accounting showing they held for 2 periods and receive coupon payments only for 2 periods. 
- The auction increased the period to 4, so when the following lines of code run to tally up the total amount of shares, it will attempt to icrease the users shares by 1 period (3 to 4) - but the user has a `balanceOf` 0 at the time of the claim since they transferred their tokens.
- As a result, the user will get 0 coupon rewards for period 3 and will only be transferred the coupon rewards for period 1 & 2, even though they held for all of the duration of period 3.

### Impact

The user who held for the entirety of the duration period for period 3 will not be awarded their coupon payment for the period, and the result will be as if they didnt hold at all for that period.

The user who received the bond tokens after period 3 ended, will receive the coupon payment for period 3 even though they didnt hold the tokens for any point within the duration period for period 3. 


### Mitigation

Use automation to call `startAuction` since it is the only place that increments the global period - getting rid of the possibility of this issue and dead time between the end of the duration for the period and the incrementing of the period.
