# Bond holders distribution will be incorrect when auction is failed due to sale pool limit

### Summary

After the distribution period reach, someone will call the `startAuction` and auction contract is deployed. If in the auction `totalSellReserveAmount` crossed the pool sale limit then auction will be failed.

```solidity
else if (
            totalSellReserveAmount >=
            (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100
        ) {
            state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
```
Now as auction is failed, pool dont have coupon token to distribute to the bond holders as of now and waits for the price appreciation of reserve token.
But here the problem is when price increases how the distribution of coupon token of that period will work! Here is what will be the approach:
```solidity
Auction fails and no coupon payments are done that period.
What will happen is governance will increase the sharesPerPeriod to be double so the coupon payment will be rolled over to the next period, in hopes the market recovers by then. Once a successfull auction is executed and all owed coupons are paid, sharesPerPeriod goes back to its normal value.
```

The problem with this approach is that if share per token is doubled in the next period then bond holder can claim 2x in the next period and also claims the share per token of the current period where auction is failed because user struct is not updated and also previousPoolAmounts will have share per token. So user can claim for both means 3x as below will calculate:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
            shares += (balance *
                globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(
                    SHARES_DECIMALS
                );
        }
```
Let's think if this approach is not taken, then if price increases in the same duration, auction cannot be start again in the same duration because of this check:
```solidity
require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >=block.timestamp,
            AuctionPeriodPassed()
        );
```
That means there is no way to distribute coupon token of the period when auction ia falied not even in the future. So it will be loss for the bond holders.

### Root Cause

None of the approach will work out.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

If 1st approach is taken then bond holder will get more coupon tokens as follow:
- share per token for 1st distribution is x where auction failed.
- so for 2nd distribution share per token will be doubled means 2x.
- Because of the non-updated structs bond holder can claim 2x+x = 3x.
- Also bond holder who comes in 2nd distribution will get 2x.

And second approach is not possible that means when auction is failed due to sale limit there is no approach how to deal with it properly.

### Impact

When auction is failed due to sale limit either protocol or bond holder will occur loss because there is no way to deal with it in the contarct.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Protocol have to find a right approach to deal with such case where auction if failed due to sale limit so that no party will have to suffer.
