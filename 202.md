# The protocol can lead to DOS for creation and redemption of derivatives if fee oracle goes down.

### Summary
In extreme case, there could be possibility that price oracle goes down, and if this happens then the `Pool.redeem()` and `Pool.create()` will distrupt.

As the flow is -
1. create -> _create -> simulateCreate -> getCreateAmount ->
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L306
```js
  function getCreateAmount(
    TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 bondSupply, 
    uint256 levSupply, 
    uint256 poolReserves, 
@-> uint256 ethPrice,
@-> uint8 oracleDecimals) public pure returns(uint256) {
      // Noice
    }
```
2. If ehPrice and oracleDecimal are 0, due to feed failure, then the function `getCreateAmount` will always revert due to divison by 0. -

```js
return ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
```
The same applies to `Pool.redeem()` as well.

Similar kind of issue has been reported before -

### Root Cause
Not using try-catch for handling price oracles.
### Impact
DOS for creation and redemption of derivatives.
### Mitigation
Use try-catch oracle handling technique.
