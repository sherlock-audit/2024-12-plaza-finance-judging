# The pool is insolvent

### Summary

In the pool fees are counted globally for all the pool but when a user redeem his bondTokens, the pool don't deduct the fees from the usd value of the redeem amount and then will make the pool insolvent.

### Root Cause

In the Pool contract the fees are accounted with all the balance of the pool as we can see here in the `getFeeAmount': 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L719

Each time a redeem occur the usd amount in the pool is calculated and the fees are deducted as we can see here in the function `simulateRedeem` : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L429-L433

After that the function `getRedeemAmount` is called to compute the reserve token amount that will be received by the user. The problem occur when the token that the user want to redeem is the the bond token. 

In order to calculate the collateral level the `getRedeemAmount` will use this formula :  
collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);

The tvl is the usd value of the reserve, depositAmount is the amount used as argument of the redeem function and BOND_TARGET_PRICE is a constant eqal to 100 (100 $ is the value of one bond token). 

The problem is that the pool have deducted the fees in the computation of the usd value but not in the depositAmount the call can therefore revert.

The more users redeem their tokens, the more insolvent the pool will become, as they will redeem a USD value higher than what is accounted for in the pool.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Fees should not be set at zero.
2. At least some time should pass between the deposit and the redeem.

### External Pre-conditions

none.

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Users will not be able to redeem their bond tokens. 

### PoC

You can run the POC by copy past this code in the Pool.t.sol file in the test folder and run `forge test --mt testRedeemPOC -vv`

```solidity
function testRedeemPOC() public {
        initializeTestCasesFixedEth();

        vm.startPrank(governance);
        Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);
         uint256 index =0;
         params.fee = 100000;

            // Mint reserve tokens
            rToken.mint(governance, calcTestCases[index].TotalUnderlyingAssets);
            rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), calcTestCases[index].TotalUnderlyingAssets);

            // Create salt to create the pool at a different address
            string memory salt = index.toString();

            // Create pool and approve deposit amount
            Pool _pool = Pool(
                poolFactory.createPool(
                    params,
                    calcTestCases[index].TotalUnderlyingAssets,
                    calcTestCases[index].DebtAssets,
                    calcTestCases[index].LeverageAssets,
                    "",
                    salt,
                    "",
                    "",
                    false
                )
            );

           

            //We wait 2 Years because we added much more reserve token than needed in the creation of the pool
            vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2*365 days);
            //We compute the fee amount
            uint256 feesAmount =  (rToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)) *  params.fee * (block.timestamp - _pool.lastFeeClaimTime()))
            / (1000000 * 365 days);
            //We can now get the usd value in the pool
            uint256 usdValue = ((rToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)) - feesAmount) * 3000e8)/1e8;
            // Call create and assert minted tokens 
            vm.expectRevert();
            _pool.redeem(calcTestCases[index].assetType, calcTestCases[index].DebtAssets-1, 0);
            //We assert that the usd value in the pool is lesser than the usd value of the amount redeemed
            assertLt(usdValue, (calcTestCases[index].DebtAssets-1)*100);
            console2.log("usd value in the pool : %d", usdValue);
            console2.log("fees claimable in the pool : %d", feesAmount);
            console2.log("usd value of the amount redeemed : %d", (calcTestCases[index].DebtAssets-1)*100);
            console2.log("difference between the 2 values : %d", int256(usdValue) - int256((calcTestCases[index].DebtAssets-1)*100));

            
        
    }

```

You should have this output : 

```solidity 
Ran 1 test for test/Pool.t.sol:PoolTest
[PASS] testRedeemPOC() (gas: 2916395)
Logs:
  usd value in the pool : 2400000000000
  fees claimable in the pool : 200000000
  usd value of the amount redeemed : 2499999999900
  difference between the 2 values : -99999999900
```
We can see that the indeed the difference between the two amount is negative and therefore the pool is insolvent.

### Mitigation

As mitigation the pool should store the timestamp when the deposit have been made and compute the fees.
