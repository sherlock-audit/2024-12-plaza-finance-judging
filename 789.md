# Previous period coupon token rewards are lost if multiple periods elapse

### Summary

Coupon token distribution to bond holders is broken if multiple periods have elapsed without calls to [Pool::distribute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589-L614).

### Root Cause

[Pool::distribute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L589-L614) is called to distribute coupon tokens to bond token holders after distribution period is passed:

```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Distributes coupon tokens to bond token holders.
   * Can only be called after the distribution period has passed.
   */
  function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    require(currentPeriod > 0, AccessDenied());

    // Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();

    if (Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT ||
        Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == Auction.State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD) {

      emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
      return;
    }

    // Get Distributor
    address distributor = poolFactory.distributors(address(this));

    // Transfer coupon tokens to the distributor
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(distributor, couponAmountToDistribute);

    // Update distributor with the amount to distribute
    Distributor(distributor).allocate(couponAmountToDistribute);

    emit Distributed(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute, distributor);
  }
```

The problem lies in how only the most recent passed period rewards can be distributed as shown by `uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;`.

By restricting to only distributing the previous rewards, this function should be called after the creation of a new auction period - but this is not an assured condition that has any guarantee of being upheld. Subsequent elapsed periods leaves past rewards undistributed in the contract if `distribute()` is not called individually after a new period auction creation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Multiple elapsed periods without calls to `distribute()`

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Period `a` elapses and a new period `b` begins without a call to `distribute()`.
2. Period `b` also elapses and a new period `c` begins.
3. Period `a` rewards are now trapped in the contract as only period `b` rewards can be distributed.

### Impact

Loss of distributor rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either one of two options would suffice:

1. Make `distribute()` an internal function that is called at the end of `Pool::startAuction()`.
2. Let the period to distribute rewards for be a passable argument to `distribute()`, with checks to make sure the period distribution period has truly elapsed with an internal mapping to ensure already distributed period rewards cannot be redistributed.
