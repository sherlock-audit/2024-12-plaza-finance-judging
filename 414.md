# Front-Running in Auction bids

#### 1. Brief
The auction’s bid mechanism is vulnerable to front-running, allowing malicious actors to displace lower bids by monitoring the mempool and submitting transactions with higher gas fees or better terms.  

#### 2. Description
**Mechanism**:  
- Bids are sorted in a linked list by price (calculated as `buyReserveAmount / sellCouponAmount`) in descending order.  
- The `insertSortedBid` function traverses the list to place new bids in the correct position.  

**Flaw**:  
- Bidders can monitor pending transactions in the mempool and submit bids with marginally better terms (e.g., slightly higher prices) to outbid existing participants.  
- Since Ethereum transactions are processed in order of gas price, attackers can prioritize their bids to execute before honest users’ transactions.  

**Example Attack Flow**:  
1. Alice submits Bid A with a price of 100.  
2. Bob observes Bid A in the mempool.  
3. Bob front-runs by submitting Bid B with a price of 101 and a higher gas fee.  
4. Bid B is processed first, taking a higher position in the sorted list.  
5. Alice’s Bid A is either pushed down in priority or removed entirely if the bid cap is reached.  

#### 3. Impact 
Honest users lose auction allocations to adversarial bidders. This undermines auction fairness and discourages participation. 

#### 4. Proof of Concept (PoC)  
**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Deploy the [Auction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125-L231) contract with `maxBids = 2`.  
2. Alice calls `bid(100, 1)` (buyReserveAmount = 100, sellCouponAmount = 1, price = 100).  
3. Bob detects Alice’s transaction in the mempool and calls `bid(101, 1)` with higher gas.  
4. Bob’s bid is processed first, becoming the highest bid.  
5. Alice’s bid is added but may be removed if the bid cap is exceeded.  

**Code Snippet (Vulnerable Logic)**:  
```solidity
// In Auction.sol
function bid(uint256 buyReserveAmount, uint256 sellCouponAmount) external {
    // ... transfers and checks ...
    insertSortedBid(newBidIndex); // Sorts bids in real-time
}

function insertSortedBid(uint256 newBidIndex) internal {
    // Vulnerable to front-running due to public bid visibility
    uint256 currentBidIndex = highestBidIndex;
    while (currentBidIndex != 0) {
        // Compare prices and insert bid
    }
}
```

#### 5. Mitigation Steps  
1. **Commit-Reveal Scheme**:  
   - **Commit Phase**: Users submit a hash of `(buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount, nonce)`.  
   - **Reveal Phase**: Users reveal bid details after a delay. Only valid commits are processed.  
   - **Effect**: Prevents attackers from seeing bid details upfront.  
2. **Batch Auctions**:  
   - Collect all bids in a fixed time window, then process them in a single batch.  
   - **Effect**: Eliminates real-time front-running opportunities.
