# PoolSaleLimit is subject to race conditions

### Summary

The `poolSaleLimit` mechanism in `Pool.sol` creates a race condition between auctions and redemptions. When an auction starts with the sale limit like `95%`, any redemptions during the auction period increase remaining holders' relative share percentages. If a holder's share grows above the sale limit (e.g., 6%) due to others redeeming, they become unable to redeem their tokens, breaking the core promise of permissionless redemptions. This is particularly problematic in bear markets when many holders attempt to exit simultaneously, potentially trapping the last large holders in the protocol.

### Root Cause

```solidity
  function setPoolSaleLimit(uint256 _poolSaleLimit) external onlyRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE()) {
    if (_poolSaleLimit < MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT) {
      revert PoolSaleLimitTooLow();
    }
    uint256 oldThreshold = poolSaleLimit;
    poolSaleLimit = _poolSaleLimit;
    emit PoolSaleLimitChanged(oldThreshold, _poolSaleLimit);
  }
```
See docs to understand the race condition better: https://docs.plaza.finance/protocol-mechanics/coupon-auction

> A new auction is created, and the system sets a 10-day period for participants to bid for ETH related assets using USDC. A portion of the underlying assets (like wstETH) in the pool are made available for bidding, not to exceed 95% percent of the value of the pool.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Presence of a sufficiently large holder.

### Attack Path

### Impact

The race condition in pool sale limits can permanently trap large token holders during market downturns. When other holders redeem during an active auction, remaining holders' share percentages increase relative to total supply. If a holder's position grows above the sale limit (e.g., 6% when limit is 95%), their tokens become frozen and unredeemable. In bear markets, this creates a problem where the final large holders are forced to hold potentially depreciating assets with no exit option.

### PoC

### Mitigation

In case such a situation occurs, a force quit structure that increases `poolSaleLimit` can be added or alternative solutions can be considered.
