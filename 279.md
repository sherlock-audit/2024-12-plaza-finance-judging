# Auction DOS Through Pool Sale Limit Manipulation

### Summary

The Auction contract contains a vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the auction to fail by placing a large bid that exceeds the pool's sale limit. The attacker can then claim back their tokens through refund, effectively griefing the auction process at minimal cost.



### Root Cause

In the [`endAuction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341) function, there's a check to ensure that the total sell reserve amount doesn't exceed a certain percentage of the pool's reserve token balance:
```javascript
else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
    state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
}
```
However, the totalSellReserveAmount can be manipulated by a malicious bidder because:

1. There's no upper limit on individual bid amounts beyond `MAX_BID_AMOUNT`
2. The bidder can claim a full refund if the auction fails
3. The poolSaleLimit check is done at auction end rather than bid time


### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker observes pool's reserve token balance
2. Places a bid with buyReserveAmount that exceeds poolSaleLimit percentage of pool balance
3. Auction fails due to the pool sale limit check
4. Attacker claims back their tokens through claimRefund
5. Process can be repeated for future auctions

### Impact

Auctions can be repeatedly forced to fail

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add pool sale limit check at bid time
