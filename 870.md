# BondToken and LevToken Holders redeem for more tokens than they deposited when collateral factor is <= 1.2

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

To redeem their tokens, BondToken and LevToken holders have to call [`Pool::Redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L353). The redeem rate applied during redemption depends on the collateral level of the protocol at the time. If the collateral level is above 1.2, we use `BOND_TARGET_PRICE * 100`, and if it is below, 80% or 20% of the vaultâ€™s collateral value per BondToken/LevToken or the market price, whichever is lower, is used. Because a fraction of the redeemRate is being used, a higher reserve token amount is calculated as the entitlement of the bondToken Holder. Using the example in the POC attached, a user who deposited 1000 WETH will be entitled to over 1100 WETH upon redemption, assuming a collateral value <=1.2. The collateral level could fall due to the reduction in the price of the total value locked in the pool.

```solidity
function getRedeemAmount() {
...............
    // Calculate the redeem rate based on the collateral level and token type
    uint256 redeemRate;
    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
    } else {
      redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
    }

    if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
      redeemRate = marketRate;
    }
    
    // Calculate and return the final redeem amount
    return ((depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) / ethPrice) / PRECISION;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

1. The price of the reserve token has to reduce enough to cause the collateral level to be <= 1.2.
2. The user has to create the bondToken when the collateral level is higher than 1.2

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The user will be entitled to more tokens than they deposit which will result in a deficit to the protocol.

### PoC

 ```solidity
 function test_vulnerability() public {
    vm.startPrank(governance);
    Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);

    rToken.mint(governance, 1000000000);
    rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 1000000000);

    Pool _pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(params, 1000000000, 25000000000, 1000000000, "", "", "", "", false));
    uint256 c_amount = _pool.getCreateAmount(
        Pool.TokenType.BOND, 
        1000,
        25000000000,
        1000000000,
        1000000000,
        3500 * CHAINLINK_DECIMAL_PRECISION,
        CHAINLINK_DECIMAL
      );

    emit log_uint(calculateCollateral(1000000000, 25000000000, 3500)); //emits the collateral level at price $3500

    emit log_uint(calculateCollateral(1000000000, 25000000000, 3000)); //emits the collateral level at a reduced price of $3000
    
    console.log("Amount of Bond Tokens received is ", c_amount);

    uint r_amount = _pool.getRedeemAmount(
        Pool.TokenType.BOND, 
        c_amount,
        25000000000 + c_amount, 
        1000000000, 
        1000000000 + 1000, 
        3000 * CHAINLINK_DECIMAL_PRECISION,
        CHAINLINK_DECIMAL,
        0
      );
    
    console.log("Amount of Bond Tokens received is ", r_amount);
  }

  function calculateCollateral(uint poolReserve, uint supply, uint ethPrice) internal returns (uint) {
    uint PRECISION = 1000000;
    return (poolReserve * ethPrice * PRECISION) / (supply * 100);
  }
```
