# Possibility of falling bellow the COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD

### Summary

In contract `Pool.sol` there is a check `collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD` and it allows for tokens to go under the threshold. 

### Root Cause

In `Pool.sol:329` `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L329-L333`, we have several checks. The first one is:
```solidity
 if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD)
```
This checks if the `collateralLevel` falls below the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`. If it does, the code proceeds to the next check:
```solidity
 if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }
```
Here, it checks if the token is of type `LEVERAGE `and whether there is any `assetSupply`. If the condition is true, it will revert. The issue arises when trying to create tokens of type `BOND` or token of type `LEVERAGE` with `assetSupply` more that 0 . This situation allows a user to set a `collateralLevel` that goes below the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, effectively rendering the threshold meaningless.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

The user must create tokens of type `BOND` or token of type `LEVERAGE` with `assetSupply` more that 0 and maintain a `collateralLevel` below the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, which is set at 1,200,000. For the `collateralLevel` to remain under the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, the `poolReserves` must have a value that is similar to or less than the `bondSupply`  or `levSupply`.

### Attack Path

The user will call `create()` , which will then call `_create()`, followed by `simulateCreate()`. In this function, we will obtain `poolReserves`, which may be similar to or even less than the value of `bondSupply` or `levSupply`.If token is of type `LEVERAGE` `levSupply` must be more than 0 . Finally, the process will conclude in `getCreateAmount()`, where the `collateralLevel` will be calculated. This level will fall below the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, but it will still be considered valid, if it passed the second check.

### Impact

Allows users to go under the collateral threshold and breaks the logic of the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Refactor the check to revert from everything that falls under the collateral threshold:
```solidity
 if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
  revert UNDER_COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD();
}
```
