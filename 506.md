# A bad actor can force an auction to fail with `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`

### Summary

Bad actors can manipulate the `totalSellReserveAmount` in the `Auction` contract for zero cost and make auctions fail.

### Root Cause

When calling `endAuction` it can fail with `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` if `totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100`

When users are bidding the `totalSellReserveAmount` is increased by the `buyReserveAmount` they want to buy.

This parameter is in control of the bidder and can be set to anything as long as it is not `0` or `> MAX_BID_AMOUNT`

Let's assume the auction is in progress and it's soon to end. In order for this to work for the attacker the sorted link list should not be full.

An attacker can make a bid just when an auction is about to end and set `buyReserveAmount` as `MAX_BID_AMOUNT` and `sellCouponAmount` as the size of one slot. This will put his bid as the lowest bid as the list is not yet full.

After that, the `endAuction` is called and it will fail with `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` because the `totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100` as it was artificially increased.

The attacker can now reclaim his failed bid and get his coupons back.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The bid list should not be full when an attacker makes a bid with a large `buyReserveAmount`.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1.) Auctions start and users start bidding
2.) At the very end of the auction an attacker makes a bid with a big `buyReserveAmount`
3.) This forces `totalSellReserveAmount` to be increased beyond the `poolLimit` and the auction to fail.

### Impact

An attacker could force auctions to fail and zero `reserveToken` will be sold to bidders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce a minimum price for the bids.
