# Lack of Validation for Identical Token Pairs in `setPriceFeed` Allows Invalid Feed Entries

### **Bug Description:**
The `setPriceFeed` function does not validate whether the two tokens provided (`tokenA` and `tokenB`) are identical. This oversight allows the creation of a price feed for an invalid token pair where both tokens are the same (e.g. `priceFeeds[tokenA][tokenA]`). Such a feed is logically nonsensical and undermines the integrity of the system, as no valid price can exist for a token against itself. For instance, the [following invalid operation is allowed by the contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleFeeds.sol#L26-L34)
```solidity
oracleFeeds.setPriceFeed(tokenA, tokenA, priceFeed, heartbeat);
```

Vulnerable code section:

```solidity
  function setPriceFeed(address tokenA, address tokenB, address priceFeed, uint256 heartbeat) external onlyRole(GOV_ROLE) {
    priceFeeds[tokenA][tokenB] = priceFeed;

    if (heartbeat == 0) {
      heartbeat = 1 days;
    }

    feedHeartbeats[priceFeed] = heartbeat;
  }
```
This results in `priceFeeds[tokenA][tokenA] = priceFeed`, which has no practical utility and could confuse consumers of the feed data, leading to misinterpretation of on-chain logic.


Medium: The bug does not directly compromise funds or governance but introduces invalid states into the system, potentially leading to incorrect functionality or misinterpretation of price feeds by [dependent contracts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L444) or applications.
The lack of validation for identical token pairs in `OracleFeeds` can result in `priceFeeds(address(bondToken), USD)` returning a feed for an invalid pair (e.g., `priceFeeds(address(bondToken), address(bondToken))`). This causes `getOraclePrice` to operate on incorrect or nonexistent feed data, potentially returning a zero or corrupted market rate (`marketRate`), leading to incorrect redemption calculations in `simulateRedeem`.

### **Primary Impact:**
Users may receive an incorrect `redeemAmount`, resulting in financial loss or over-redemption, especially when relying on faulty or manipulated oracle data.

### **Mitigation:**
Add a validation check in `setPriceFeed` to ensure `tokenA` and `tokenB` are not identical:
```solidity
require(tokenA != tokenB, "Token pair cannot be identical");
```
