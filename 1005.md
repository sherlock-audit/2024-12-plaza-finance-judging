# A user can avoid his deposit from being accounted for fees

### Summary

in `Pool.sol` , a user can frontrun claim fees transaction and withdraw his deposit right before the fees are collected by a governor, and deposit right after that again. 

### Root Cause

There is no timespan between deposit and redeem functions in `Pool.sol`, also fees are not collected before the deposit is redeemed.
