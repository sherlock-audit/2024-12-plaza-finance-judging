# Pool::getRedeemAmount uses division before multiplication when calculating redeemRate

### Summary

`   redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;`

if assetSupply > (tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE))  which would indicate a redeem rate of less than 1 then entire computation will round down to zero 

 in solidity, the result of a computation is always rounded down, so when the code calculates ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) , it will round it down to zero 
0 * precision is still zero 

and reserveAmount to be received ends up being zero 
this then causes a revert [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L397-L399)

### Root Cause

use of division before multiplication when computing 

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

users cannot withdraw their tokens when redeemRate < 1

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

rewrite the code 
`   redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) *PRECISION) / assetSupply ;`
