# Incorrect userData Handling in Balancer Router's `exitPlazaAndBalancer` operation.

### Summary

Incorrect handling of userData in `exitPlazaAndBalancer` will cause revert or execution with invalid parameters when attempting to exit both Plaza and Balancer pools in a single transaction, since the required BPT amount for userData is only known after the Plaza Pool exit is completed.

### Root Cause

When calling [exitPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L141) function on the balancer vault which is called in [BalancerRouter::exitBalancerPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L125C14-L125C30), the request contains `userData`.

Now for the exitPool function on the balancer vault, it needs to know the amount of balancer pool tokens a user wants to deposit. That's where the `userData` comes in to play. This `balancerPoolTokenIn` needs to encoded into the `userData` bytes together with the exit kind.

So the issue is that [exitPlazaAndBalancer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L92) has [userData](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L98) as an argument of the function. But in reality, the caller of the function will not be able to guess the value of [balancerPoolTokenReceived](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L103C17-L103C42) which is received from plaza pool before hand so as to encode it into the userData bytes.

The rather "guessed" or "empty" userData will be forwarded into the [exitBalancerPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L106) which will make the whole transaction to revert or funds to be stuck in the BalancerRouter when guessed BPTIn is anything lower than the actual `balancerPoolTokenReceived`

Plaza's test suite missed this issue because they used a MockVault which was **oversimplified** and not similar to how an actual Balancer vault is.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have Plaza tokens (either Bond or Leverage tokens) to initiate the exit
2. User needs to have approved the BalancerRouter contract to spend their Plaza tokens
3. Plaza Pool needs to be active and not paused

### External Pre-conditions

1. Balancer Pool needs to be active and allow exits
2. Balancer Pool needs to have sufficient liquidity for the exit

### Attack Path

1. User calls exitPlazaAndBalancer with guessed or empty userData
2. Function executes exitPlazaPool which returns balancerPoolTokenReceived
3. Function attempts to use the original userData with exitBalancerPool, but this userData contains incorrect/invalid bptIn amount
4. Transaction either reverts or executes with incorrect parameters, potentially causing loss of funds

### Impact

The protocol functionality is broken as users cannot properly exit from both Plaza and Balancer pools in a single transaction. This could lead to:
- Users being unable to exit their positions efficiently
- Potential loss of funds if the transaction executes with incorrect parameters


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Try to generate the userData dynamically after getting balancerPoolTokenReceived:
```solidity
function exitPlazaAndBalancer(
    bytes32 balancerPoolId,
    address _plazaPool,
    IAsset[] memory assets,
    uint256 plazaTokenAmount,
    uint256[] memory minAmountsOut,
    Pool.TokenType plazaTokenType,
    uint256 minbalancerPoolTokenOut
) external nonReentrant {
    // Step 1: Exit Plaza Pool
    uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = exitPlazaPool(
        plazaTokenType,
        _plazaPool,
        plazaTokenAmount,
        minbalancerPoolTokenOut
    );

    // Step 2: Generate userData with actual BPT amount
    bytes memory userData = abi.encode(
        WeightedPoolUserData.ExitKind.EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_TOKENS_OUT,
        balancerPoolTokenReceived
    );

    // Step 3: Exit Balancer Pool
    exitBalancerPool(
        balancerPoolId,
        assets,
        balancerPoolTokenReceived,
        minAmountsOut,
        userData,
        msg.sender
    );
}
```
