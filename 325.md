# A whale bondtoken holder can not claim his coupon shares almost permanently

### Summary

The bondholders receive their coupon shares from the distributor. In the pool, it starts the auction with `couponAmountToDistribute`, and after the success of the auction, it distributes coupon tokens to the distributor. However, if the auction fails, it becomes very difficult for holders of a large amount of bond tokens to claim their coupon shares, and they may never be able to claim them.

### Root Cause

Anyone can call the [startAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530C3-L571C4), which initiates the auction. Focus on `couponAmountToDistribute`.

```solidity
  function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
    ...
    uint256 normalizedTotalSupply = bondToken.totalSupply().normalizeAmount(bondDecimals, maxDecimals);
    uint256 normalizedShares = sharesPerToken.normalizeAmount(sharesDecimals, maxDecimals);

    // Calculate the coupon amount to distribute
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)
        .toBaseUnit(maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
    ...
  }
```

As you can see, it calculates the coupon amount for one period, specifically the last period. It does not account for previous periods before the last one. After the auction ends, coupon tokens are transferred to the pool only if the [auction is successful](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L343C4-L347C6). If the last auction is unsuccessful, the pool [distributes nothing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L597C5-L602C6), and [`couponAmountToDistribute` is not increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L610C1-L611C65) in the Distributor. This means that the entire coupon amount to distribute for one period is erased in the Distributor.

This critically impacts all bond token holders. When holders claim their coupon tokens, they cannot receive their shares if [`couponAmountToDistribute` is below the shares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L95C5-L98C6). Here, holders must receive their entire shares, not just a portion. However, as smaller holders claim their shares, `couponAmountToDistribute` continuously decreases, while over time, a whale bond token holder's shares increase. More importantly, there is no mechanism to refill the coupon amount for periods when auctions fail.

### PoC

```solidity
function testForWhaleBondHolder() public {
    Token sharesToken = Token(_pool.couponToken());
    address user1 = address(0x61);
    address user2 = address(0x62);
    address user3 = address(0x63);
    
    vm.startPrank(address(_pool));
    _pool.bondToken().mint(user1, 1000*10**18);
    _pool.bondToken().mint(user2, 100*10**18);
    _pool.bondToken().mint(user3, 200*10**18);
    uint256 coupons = params.sharesPerToken * 1500;
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(governance);
    fakeSucceededAuction(address(_pool), 0);
    // fakeSucceededAuction(address(_pool), 1); Second auction is failed
    fakeSucceededAuction(address(_pool), 2);

    vm.mockCall(
      address(0),
      abi.encodeWithSignature("state()"),
      abi.encode(uint256(1))
    );

    vm.mockCall(
      address(0),
      abi.encodeWithSignature("totalBuyCouponAmount()"),
      abi.encode(coupons * 10**sharesToken.decimals())
    );

    // increase indexed asset period - this is done by Pool when Auction starts but its mocked on this test
    _pool.bondToken().increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(params.sharesPerToken);

    vm.startPrank(_pool);
    sharesToken.mint(address(_pool), coupons * 10 ** sharesToken.decimals());  // 75000e18
    _pool.distribute();
    // coupons of the first period successfully distributed
    // but all of users don't claim coupons in second period

    vm.startPrank(governance);
    // second auction is failed
    _pool.bondToken().increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(params.sharesPerToken);

    // user2 claims his coupons : 10000e18
    vm.startPrank(user2);
    distributor.claim();

    // user3 claims his coupons : 40000e18
    vm.startPrank(user3);
    distributor.claim();

     // user1 also wants to claim his coupons but he can't receive coupons : 100000e18
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    vm.expectRevert(Distributor.NotEnoughSharesBalance.selector);  // balance : 25000e18
    distributor.claim();
}
```

### Mitigation

Add functionality to allow for the claiming of coupon shares individually.
