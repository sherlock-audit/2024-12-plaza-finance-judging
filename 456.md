# BondToken#SHARES_DECIMALS is hardcoded to 6 which will cause large error for share tokens that are not 6 dp

### Summary

BondToken hardcodes SHARES_DECIMALS to 6. This works for the initial deployment that utilizes USDC as the coupon token but this will cause a large issue if used with a coupon token that is not 6 dp. As stated in the readme it is intended to be compatible with all normal ERC20 tokens which includes 18 dp tokens.

[BondToken.sol#L71](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L71)

    uint8 public constant SHARES_DECIMALS = 6;

[BondToken.sol#L190-L199](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L190-L199)

        function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
            IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
            uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

            for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
    @>          shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
            }

            return shares;
        }

We see above that we have a hardcoded value for SHARES_DECIMALS. If the coupon token is not 6 dp then this will greatly overestimate the number of tokens owed to bond holders, which will cause the contract to pay out much higher amounts than expected.

### Root Cause

[BondToken.sol#L71](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L71) is hardcoded instead of being dynamic to the coupon token

### Internal preconditions

None

### External preconditions

Coupon token is not 6 dp

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Coupon tokens with greater then 6 dp will break the contract suite

### POC

N/A

### Mitigation

SHARES_DECIMALS should be set dynamically in initialize
