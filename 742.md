# Attacker can Win Any Auction with 1 wei

### Summary

There is no minimum amount of bid an auction starts with like in other auction where the bidding will start from $50M or 50 ETH. There is also a `maxBids` which checks the maximum number of bids that can be placed in an auction. An attacker knowing this, they can quickly place bids a low a 1 wei multiple times to reach the maxBids to win the audit. 

### Root Cause

There is no minimum amount that a first bidder must have in order to place a [bid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125-L171). This can allow an attacker place very low bid such as 1 wei multiple times to reach the [`maxBids`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L153-L158) which will prevent legitimate bidders from bidding or partaking in the auction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The attacker should be able to place the first bid with 1 wei 
2. The attacker should be able submit multiple 1 wei bids to reach the `maxBids` limit

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Place multiple bids in the auction with 1 wei at the beginning of the auction
2. Reach the `maxBids` limit

### Impact

1. Attacker wins the auction with 1 wei which is very much unfair
2. Legetimate bidders will not get the chance to participate in the auction 
3. Attacker can win every single auction as long as they the place the first bid

### PoC

```solidity
function testBidSuccessMultiBidsWithWei() public {
    address legetimateUser = address(0x123131);

    usdc.mint(bidder, 100 ether);
    usdc.mint(legetimateUser, 1000 ether);

    weth.mint(address(auction), 1000000000000 ether);

    uint256 slot = auction.slotSize();

    vm.startPrank(bidder);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 40 ether);

    auction.bid(1, slot);

    auction.bid(1, slot);

    auction.bid(1, slot);

    auction.bid(1, slot);

    auction.bid(1, slot);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(legetimateUser);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 100 ether);
    vm.expectRevert();
    auction.bid(45 ether, slot);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
    vm.prank(pool);
    auction.endAuction();

    vm.prank(bidder);
    auction.claimBid(1);
  }
```


### Mitigation

Set a minimum amount the first bidder must place.
