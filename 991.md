# Excess Balancer Pool Tokens Are Not Returned to Users in joinBalancerAndPredeposit()

### Summary

The function joinBalancerAndPreDeposit() in BalancerRouter.sol deposits pool tokens into the PreDeposit contract. If the reserveAmount in the PreDeposit contract reaches its reserveCap, only the required amount of tokens is deposited, but any excess pool tokens remain locked in the BalancerRouter contract and are not returned to the user. This results in the loss of user funds.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L37

The issue lies in the handling of excess pool tokens during the deposit process.

`BalancerRouter.sol::joinBalancerAndPredeposit()`:-

```javascript
    function joinBalancerAndPredeposit(
        bytes32 balancerPoolId,
        address _predeposit,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        uint256 balancerPoolTokenReceived = joinBalancerPool(balancerPoolId, assets, maxAmountsIn, userData);
        balancerPoolToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(_predeposit, balancerPoolTokenReceived);
@>      PreDeposit(_predeposit).deposit(balancerPoolTokenReceived, msg.sender);
        return balancerPoolTokenReceived;
    }
```

`PreDeposit.sol::deposit()`:-

```javascript
    function _deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) private checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
@>      if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached();

        address recipient = onBehalfOf == address(0) ? msg.sender : onBehalfOf;

        if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
@>          amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
        }

        balances[recipient] += amount;
        reserveAmount += amount;

@>      IERC20(params.reserveToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

        emit Deposited(recipient, amount);
    }
```
The _deposit() function only transfers the required tokens to meet the reserveCap, but any excess pool tokens remain in BalancerRouter without being refunded to the user. This creates a scenario where users lose the excess tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

reserveAmount in the PreDeposit contract is close to or equal to reserveCap.

### External Pre-conditions

Users provide sufficient assets to joinBalancerPool to generate excess pool tokens.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users lose these tokens as they are not refunded or usable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add logic to refund excess pool tokens to the user in joinBalancerAndPredeposit()
