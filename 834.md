# Due to mistake in fees calculation logic considering the reserve token balance of pool at the time of claiming fees protocol would not be able to claim the actual fees amount in different duration leading to incorrect or loss in fees funds for protocol

### Summary

The logic for calculating fees in function [getFeeAmount ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L718) is wrong as it considers the amount of reserve token balance in Pool contract at time of claiming fees through [claimFees ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L700C12-L700C21) which would not calculate the actual fees that needs to be deducted since the last claim and different time durations as there might be some users who have redeem and some new users who have created in between that timeline leading to protocol not able to claim correct amount of fees and resulting in loss in funds for protocol or incorrect fees amount.

### Root Cause

The choice to considering reserve token balance at time of calling claimFees as stated in [Pool.sol:719](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L719) is wrong as it would only calculate fees on the amount that is present at that particular block of calling and not past changes in balances since last claim duration. Hence protocol might not be able to claim the correct amount of fees.

Example:- If pool is initiated with 1000 ETH and user have create 100 ETH reserve token for LevETH and after 30 days user redeems those LevETH tokens in full after that if [claimFees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L700C12-L700C21) is called they should be able to receive fees on 1100 ETH for that particular duration but it will only receive for 1000 ETH amount which is present in the Pool.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Pool initialized with 1000 ETH reserve tokens and 2% fees
2. User A deposits 100 ETH through create function and mints LevETH
3. 30 days period passes
4. User A redeems all amount of those LevETH token received
5. Protocol calls claimFees function but receive only fees on 1000 ETH amount which is present in pool leading to loss in fees funds for protocol

### Impact

As the fees calculation logic is wrong it would not calculate fees correctly and in some cases protocol suffers loss in fees funds if the amount of underlying reserve token amount in Pool at time of claiming fees is less then the amount present during the whole period and in some cases it may claim higher fees then it should. In general there is incosistency in fees calculation based on duration and whole fees calculation mechanism is flawed due to it.

### PoC

```solidity
  function testCreateRedeemWithFees() public {
    vm.startPrank(governance);

    // Create a pool with 2% fee
    params.fee = 20000; // 2% fee (1000000 precision)
    params.feeBeneficiary = address(0x942);

    // Mint and approve reserve tokens
    Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);
    rToken.mint(governance, 1000 ether);
    rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 1000 ether);

    Pool pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(params, 1000 ether, 500 ether, 250 ether, "", "", "", "", false));
    vm.stopPrank();

    address feeBeneficiary = pool.feeBeneficiary();

    // User creates leverage tokens
    vm.startPrank(user);
    
    rToken.mint(user, 100 ether);
    rToken.approve(address(pool), 100 ether);
    uint256 levAmount = pool.create(Pool.TokenType.LEVERAGE, 100 ether, 0);
    console.log("levAmount", levAmount);
    // Advance time by 30 days
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);
    
    mockPriceFeed.setMockPrice(3000 * int256(CHAINLINK_DECIMAL_PRECISION), uint8(CHAINLINK_DECIMAL));

    // Calculate expected fee
    uint256 expectedFee = (1100 ether * params.fee * 30 days) / (1000000 * 365 days);
    console.log("expectedFee", expectedFee);

    // User redeems leverage tokens
    pool.bondToken().approve(address(pool), levAmount);
    uint256 redeemedAmount = pool.redeem(Pool.TokenType.LEVERAGE, levAmount, 0);
    console.log("redeemedAmount", redeemedAmount);

    vm.stopPrank();
    uint256 initialBalance = rToken.balanceOf(feeBeneficiary);
    vm.startPrank(feeBeneficiary);
    pool.claimFees();
    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.startPrank(user);
    uint256 finalBalance = rToken.balanceOf(feeBeneficiary);
    console.log("finalBalance - initialBalance", finalBalance - initialBalance);

    // User should get back less than initial deposit due to fees
    assertLt(redeemedAmount, 100 ether);
    
    // Verify fee amount is correct
    uint256 actualFee = 100 ether - redeemedAmount;
    console.log("actualFee", actualFee);
    assertApproxEqRel((finalBalance - initialBalance), expectedFee, 0.05e18); // 5% tolerance

    vm.stopPrank();

    // Reset state
    rToken.burn(user, rToken.balanceOf(user));
    rToken.burn(address(pool), rToken.balanceOf(address(pool)));
  }
```

### Mitigation

Need to change the fees calculation method instead of calculating it with `IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR` which is wrong need to track through a variable at time of create and redeem and return that variable value at time of claimFees.
