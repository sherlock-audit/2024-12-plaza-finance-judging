# Malicious actors can prevent auction to be succeed

### Summary

Malicious actors can prevent auction to be succeed 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341


### Attack Path
Users can specify the bid price in the Auction::bid function by passing sellCouponAmount and buyReserveAmount as parameters. An auction has a defined period, and once this period ends, anyone can trigger the auction's conclusion. However, if the total sellReserveAmount exceeds 90%[sale_limit] of pool reserve (which is configurable), the auction state transitions to FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT. In this state, users can claim back their bid amounts.

A malicious actor can exploit this mechanism to disrupt the auction process. Hereâ€™s how:

Legitimate users place their bids and wait for the auction to conclude. At the last moment, a malicious actor calls Auction::bid with a large buyReserveAmount[max_amount is 1e50] and an appropriately high sellCouponAmount (ensuring it isn't the lowest bid). This causes the auction to reach the FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT state, preventing the distribution of coupon tokens to bond token holders. Consequently, a new auction must be initiated to distribute the tokens,

```solidity
    @>>>    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
```


### Impact

delaying the process and potentially frustrating participants. 

### Mitigation

consider to handle exess amount for buyReserveAmount
