# Misaligned Fee Deduction in `simulateCreate` and `simulateRedeem`

### **Summary**  
The logic for fee deduction in the functions `simulateCreate` and `simulateRedeem` will cause **incorrect simulation results** for **users** as the **fee is subtracted from the simulated pool reserves without actually affecting on-chain balances**, leading to discrepancies between simulations and actual outcomes.

---

### **Root Cause**  
In the [simulateCreate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L262-L293) and [simulateRedeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L422-L463) functions, the `poolReserves` value is adjusted for fees [using this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L433):  
```solidity
poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
```

As you can notice:
   - The calculated fee is subtracted from the `poolReserves` in memory only during the simulation. The actual on-chain reserve balance is not updated until `claimFees()` is called. This creates a mismatch between the simulated results and the actual minting/redeeming outcomes when users interact with the contract.
   - The fee calculation depends on `(block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)`. As time progresses, the fee increases, causing unpredictable simulation results for users.
   - Users may simulate an action and expect a certain result, only to experience different outcomes during actual execution, breaking user expectations.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**
1. The protocol has not called `claimFees()` recently, leaving `lastFeeClaimTime` outdated.
2. A user calls `simulateCreate` or `simulateRedeem` to estimate the outcome of a minting or redemption operation.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**
1. Time has passed since the last fee claim, increasing `(block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)`.
2. Users expect simulation results to match the actual transaction outcomes.

---

### **Attack Path**  
This issue is not easily exploitable but can cause confusion or financial discrepancies for users:

1. A user calls `simulateCreate` or `simulateRedeem` to calculate expected outcomes.
   - The simulation adjusts `poolReserves` based on a fee that has not been deducted on-chain.
2. The user proceeds with the actual transaction (`create` or `redeem`).
   - The outcome does not match the simulation because the real reserve balance does not reflect the simulated fee deduction.
3. The user suffers financial discrepancies due to incorrect expectations.

---

### **Impact**

Simulated operations may incorrectly predict minting or redemption amounts, potentially underestimating or overestimating returns.

---

### **Mitigation**
Always call `claimFees()` to update on-chain balances before performing simulations.
