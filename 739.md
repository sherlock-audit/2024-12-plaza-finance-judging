# [M-01] Denial of Service Vulnerability in Deposit Function (Zero-Value Deposits)


**Description:**  
The `_deposit` function in `preDeposit.sol` lacks a check for zero-value deposits. This allows attackers to submit numerous zero-value deposits, consuming gas without altering the contract's state. These wasted gas transactions can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS), where legitimate users or governance must pay excessive gas fees to clear the unnecessary deposits before processing valid transactions.

**Impact:**  
Attackers can flood the contract with zero-value deposits, causing the contract to become unresponsive. Since clearing these useless deposits requires significant gas, legitimate operations may be blocked if the governance cannot afford the gas fees, effectively locking the contract and its funds.

**Proof of Concept:**  
1. An attacker submits numerous zero-value deposits via the `_deposit` function.
2. These deposits consume gas without changing the state.
3. To process further valid deposits, the system must first clear the attacker's deposits, requiring the same excessive gas cost.
4. If the governance cannot afford this gas, the contract will be locked.

**Recommended Mitigation:**  
Implement a check to prevent zero-value deposits:

```solidity
function _deposit(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) private checkDepositStarted checkDepositNotEnded {
    require(amount > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than zero");
    // existing logic continues...
}
```

This will prevent the Denial of Service attack and ensure the contract processes only valid deposits.
