# Users Accumulate Bond Shares During Failed Auctions Without USDC Backing

### Summary

When auctions fail, users still accumulate shares for that period but no USDC is distributed, creating a mismatch between accumulated shares and available USDC for claims. This could lead to insufficient USDC in the Distributor for user claims.


### Root Cause

During a failed auction, the period info is still saved and shares continue to accumulate, but no USDC is allocated:

In Pool.sol [distribute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L597-L601)() - Failed auction handling:
```solidity
function distribute() external whenNotPaused {
    // On failed auction, just emits event and returns
    if (Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD ||
        Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).state() == State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT) {
        emit DistributionRollOver(previousPeriod, couponAmountToDistribute);
        return;
    }
}
```

In Distributor.sol - during claiming, the shares is calculated thru [getIndexedUserAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L88).
```solidity
function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    // Get current period and user's bond balance
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    
    // Calculate shares including failed auction periods
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(
        msg.sender, 
        balance, 
        currentPeriod
    );
}

```
However, in BondToken.sol [getIndexedUserAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L190-L198) , shares still accumulate, no specific handling for failed auctions. 

```solidity
function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    // Loops through ALL periods, including failed ones
    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
        shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken)
            .toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }
}
```

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User holds `bondEth` tokens
2. Auctions 1-5 occur, Auction 3 fails
3. User tries to claim after period 5
4. `getIndexedUserAmount` includes shares from failed period 3
5. Not enough USDC in Distributor to cover all claims

### Impact

Since shares continue to accumulate during failed auction periods, this creates a discrepancy between total user shares and available USDC in the Distributor. When users attempt to claim, there won't be enough USDC backing for all the accumulated shares. This leads to a "first come, first served" situation where early claimers might receive their USDC while later claimers could have their transactions revert due to insufficient USDC balance, causing unfair distribution and potential loss of rightfully earned rewards for some bondToken holders.

### Mitigation

Skip periods with failed auctions during share calculation.
