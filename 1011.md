# Claim Excessive Rewards by Manipulating Collateral Level

### **Summary**

```solidity
  function getCreateAmount(
    TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 bondSupply, 
    uint256 levSupply, 
    uint256 poolReserves, 
    uint256 ethPrice,
    uint8 oracleDecimals) public pure returns(uint256) {
    if (bondSupply == 0) {
      revert ZeroDebtSupply();
    }

    uint256 assetSupply = bondSupply;
    uint256 multiplier = POINT_EIGHT;
    if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      multiplier = POINT_TWO;
      assetSupply = levSupply;
    }

    uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
    uint256 collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
    uint256 creationRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;

    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }
      creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      if (assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }

      uint256 adjustedValue = tvl - (BOND_TARGET_PRICE * bondSupply);
      creationRate = (adjustedValue * PRECISION) / assetSupply;
    }
  
    return ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
  }

```

In the `Pool.getCreateAmount` function, it can be seen that when the `collateralLevel` is exactly equal to the `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD`, the multiplier used is 0.8. It's worth noting that `1.2 * 0.8 = 0.96`, which is still different from 1, creating a small space for profit. The attacker can monitor the state variables of the `Pool` contract. Since the `Pool.create` function first calls `Pool.getCreateAmount` and gets the result before transferring `reserveToken` and `bondToken`, the transfer in this step will not affect the `collateralLevel` calculation.

```solidity
uint256 poolReserves = IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this))
                          .normalizeTokenAmount(reserveToken, COMMON_DECIMALS);
```

In the calculation of `poolReserves`, the `balanceOf` function is used directly. Additionally, during `redeem`, the price of `bondToken` will only be 100 when `collateralLevel` is greater than 1.2.

```solidity
collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
```


### **Attack Path**

1. **Step 1:**  The attacker detects that the current `collateralLevel` is exactly 1200000. Consider the following scenario:

    * `tvl = 12000000000`
    * `bondSupply = 100`
    * `BOND_TARGET_PRICE = 100`

    At this point, `collateralLevel` is calculated as `12000000000 / (100 * 100) = 1200000`, so the price of `bondToken` is 96. Even if `tvl` increases slightly, its price will still be 100.
2. **Step 2:**  The attacker deposits reserveTokens worth 5000, receiving 5000 / 96 \= 52 bondTokens.
3. **Step 3:**  The attacker's goal is to increase `collateralLevel` to just over 1200000, raising the price of `bondToken` to 100. Since `COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD = 1200000`, the attacker can manipulate `collateralLevel` by depositing an additional reserveToken worth 200.01. After this deposit, the updated calculations are as follows:

    ```solidity
    collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
    ```

    Where:

    * `tvl = 12000000000 + 5000000000 + 200010000 = 17200010000`
    * `depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION = (52 * 100) * 1000000 = 5200000000`
    * `tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE) = 12000010000`
    * `bondSupply - depositAmount = 152 - 52 = 100`

    Thus, the updated `collateralLevel` is calculated as `12000010000 / (100 * 100) = 1200001`.
4. **Step 4:**  The attacker redeems the tokens and earns a profit of `52 * (100 - 96) = 208`. After subtracting the cost of depositing the reserveToken (`200.01`), the attacker's net profit is `208 - 200.01 = 7.99`.


### **Root Cause**

The reward calculation is based on the number of `bondToken` held at the current moment in a period, without considering the actual duration of the bondToken holdings. This allows attackers to exploit the timing of `collateralLevel` manipulation to unfairly claim rewards.


### **Affected Code**

### **Impact**

The attacker can perform a risk-free trade by exploiting `collateralLevel` and claim rewards without holding `bondToken` for the required period.


### **Mitigation**

Set `POINT_EIGHT` to `833333` to significantly reduce the space for attackers to profit unfairly. This will minimize the opportunity for attackers to manipulate `collateralLevel` and unfairly claim rewards.
