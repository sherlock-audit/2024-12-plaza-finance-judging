# Unsuccessful auction states allow early claimers to drain coupon tokens at the expense of late claimers due to unallocated distributions.

### Summary

The design of the `Distributor.claim()` function depends on `BondToken.getIndexedUserAmount()`,

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L190-L199

```solidity
  function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }
```
to calculate user shares, incrementing for each unclaimed period. However, in `Auction.endAuction()`, coupon tokens (`buyCouponToken`) are transferred to the Pool only when the auction state is `SUCCEEDED`. For failed states (`FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` or `FAILED_UNDERSOLD`), no coupon tokens are transferred to the `Distributor`.

This creates a critical vulnerability:

- Users claiming earlier can drain the available coupon tokens (`couponAmountToDistribute`) at the expense of late claimers, as the `Distributor` does not differentiate between successful and failed auction periods.
- Late claimers will find no remaining tokens even if they have accumulated shares.

### Root Cause

1. The `Distributor.claim()` function calculates user shares based on all unclaimed periods, regardless of whether auctions in those periods were successful.
2. In `Auction.endAuction()`, `buyCouponToken` is only transferred to the Pool (`beneficiary`)when the auction state is `SUCCEEDED`. For failed states, no coupon tokens are allocated for distribution.
3. `Pool.distribute()` transfers coupon tokens to the `Distributor` only when tokens are available, meaning failed auctions result in no distributions.
4. The lack of differentiation between successful and failed auctions allows early claimers to drain tokens distributed from successful auctions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The auction state is `SUCCEEDED` for at least one period, resulting in `buyCouponToken` being transferred to the `Pool` and distributed to the `Distributor`.
2. The auction state is `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` or `FAILED_UNDERSOLD` for subsequent periods, meaning no tokens are distributed for these periods.
3. Early claimers call `Distributor.claim()` before late claimers.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A permissionless call to `Pool.distribute()` is required to transfer tokens from the `Pool` to the `Distributor`.
2. The protocol does not prevent early claimers from draining tokens allocated from successful auctions, leaving no tokens for late claimers.


### Attack Path

This is not a direct attack but a design flaw with significant implications for fairness:

1. User A claims their shares early, depleting `couponAmountToDistribute` in Distributor.sol. As can be seen from the logic below, `shares` is assigned the [indexed amount of shares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L190-L199) regardless of whether or not the auction has been successful for all periods. And for as long as `IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this))` and `couponAmountToDistribute` are separately greater than or equal to `shares`. A `shares` amount of `couponToken` will be transferred to user A after resetting the indexed user assets.

```solidity
  function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    BondToken bondToken = Pool(pool).bondToken();
    address couponToken = Pool(pool).couponToken();

    if (address(bondToken) == address(0) || couponToken == address(0)){
      revert UnsupportedPool();
    }

    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());

    if (IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < shares) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesBalance();
    }
    
    // check if pool has enough *allocated* shares to distribute
    if (couponAmountToDistribute < shares) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesToDistribute();
    }

    // check if the distributor has enough shares tokens as the amount to distribute
    if (IERC20(couponToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < couponAmountToDistribute) {
      revert NotEnoughSharesToDistribute();
    }

    couponAmountToDistribute -= shares;    
    bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
    
    emit ClaimedShares(msg.sender, currentPeriod, shares);
  }
```
2. User B attempts to claim their shares later but finds no or insufficient coupon tokens available, despite having valid shares calculated by `BondToken.getIndexedUserAmount()`.

### Impact

- Early claimers drain the available coupon tokens, leaving late claimers with no tokens despite valid shares. 
- Users from periods with failed auctions still accumulate shares that cannot be redeemed due to a lack of corresponding coupon tokens.
- Late claimers lose trust in the protocol as they perceive the system as unfair and unreliable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a mechanism to track whether the auction for a specific period was successful. Use this information to limit share accumulation and claims to only successful periods.
