# Users can claim coupons for previous periods even if he wasn't a bondholder

### Summary

Users can claim coupons for previous periods even if he wasn't a bondholder at the previous periods, because `getIndexedUserAmount()` uses the same `balance` value for all periods, assuming user was a bondholder in the past. The protocol assumes that the user joined the pool from the beginning, although this may not be the case.



### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L194-L196)

Per [docs](https://docs.plaza.finance/protocol-mechanics/coupon-distributions):
>It determines which period the asset has been transferred in and tallies up all of the unclaimed coupons for each period. Therefore, there is always a running record of each holder and the distribution period that they have held at. Thus, when a distribution occurs and the period increases, there is still evidence that the user was holding a bond in previous periods and the user will be eligible to claim previous coupons from the Distributor. 

Protocol expects that user can claim coupons for those distribution periods in which he was a bondholder, assuming that user's balance will be updated in every periods. But if user did not transfered `BOND` or claimed coupons, coupon amount to distribute will not be recorded for previous periods.

```solidity
 for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

User's balance should not be updated in previous periods - meaning that user does not participate in these periods.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Amelie did not participate in first 3 periods, did not claim or transfer `BOND`, `lastUpdatedPeriod` = 0, balance = 0 `BOND` tokens;
2. Amelie makes deposit in the start of 4 period and receives 1 `BOND` token;
3. Amelie's `getIndexedUserAmount` should be zero for first 3 periods, because she joined to a pool only during 4 period;
4. Amelis calls `claim()` from `Distributor.sol` and receives 10 `USDC` anyway (assume shares per token = 2.5):
```solidity
 for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }
```
And because `getIndexedUserAmount()` uses the same `balance` value for all 4 periods, `shares` will be 10, although Amelie's actual balance may be 0 in first 3 periods.

For example, there is similar [scenario from the docs](https://docs.plaza.finance/protocol-mechanics/coupon-distributions#:~:text=Every%20time%20a,amount%20to%20him.). We can see how 2 users will receive the same amount. Although Amelie has 0 `BOND` tokens in first 3 periods, but claimed 7.5 `USDC`.

### Impact

Users can claim coupons for previous periods even if they wasn't a bondholder at the previous periods.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Users should claim rewards only for the periods in which they participated.
