# BondToken::increaseIndexedAssetPeriod NatSpec Issue

### Summary

The `BondToken::increaseIndexedAssetPeriod` function, according to its NatSpec, is expected to be called by an address with the `GOV_ROLE`. However, its modifier verifies the `DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE` instead.

### Root Cause

The mismatch between the expected role (GOV_ROLE according to NatSpec) and the actual role being verified (DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE in the modifier) causes the issue.
