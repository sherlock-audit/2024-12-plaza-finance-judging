# Failure to Handle Token Transfer Reverts in **Auction.claimBid()** function

### Summary

The `claimBid` function directly calls the `transfer` function on the `IERC20` token without handling potential reverts. If the `transfer` call fails, the state change (`bidInfo.claimed = true`) will persist, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state. This could result in loss of funds or the inability for the bidder to reclaim their funds.

From the screenshot provided, the transfer failed because the `IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer` method did not revert when the transfer was unsuccessful. However, the other function using `safeTransfer` from OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library did fail. Here's why:

### Why the `transfer` Call Did Not Revert

The ERC-20 `transfer` function, as defined in the original ERC-20 standard, returns a `bool` to indicate success or failure. If a token contract strictly adheres to this behavior and does not explicitly revert on failure, the calling contract will not revert unless the returned value is checked and handled explicitly.

In the provided test, the `IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer` call likely returned `false`, indicating a failure, but since the returned value wasn't checked, the transaction continued without reverting. The contract's state could become inconsistent as a result.

### Why the `safeTransfer` Call Reverted

The `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` function from OpenZeppelin's library wraps the `transfer` call and includes checks to ensure that the call succeeds. If the `transfer` function returns `false` or reverts, `safeTransfer` will enforce a revert by using low-level assembly to verify the success of the call.

In the test, the `IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer` call failed and reverted the transaction because:

1. The underlying token `transfer` call returned `false` or reverted.
2. `SafeERC20` detected the failure and enforced a revert, as it does not allow silent failures.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L362
```solidity
bidInfo.claimed = true;
// @audit-issue Failure to Handle Token Transfer Reverts
IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);

```

### Attack Path

1. if you navigate to : https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/dbb6104ce834628e473d2173bbc9d47f81a9eec3/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L109
and set the transfer function return value to `false`

2. Run the foundry test and the transferring of token to the owner will fail but the transaction will return successful Duo to lack of revert value check 

### Impact

- Funds may be locked or unrecoverable if the token transfer fails.
- Bidders may lose confidence in the system due to potential inconsistencies.
- The contract state becomes inconsistent, as the bid is marked as claimed, even though the transfer did not occur.

and set the transfer function return value to `false` and run the test the transaction will fail but the `claimBid()` will run successfully even duo the transfer of token to the owner was not successful 

```solidity
 function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public virtual returns (bool) {
        address owner = _msgSender();
        _transfer(owner, to, value);
        - return true;
        + return false;
```

foundry Test: 

```solidity
 function testClaimBidExploit() public {

    // Start acting as a bidder

    vm.startPrank(bidder);

  

    // Mint tokens and approve for bidding

    weth.mint(address(auction), 1000000000000 ether);

    usdc.mint(bidder, 1000000000000 ether);

    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000000000000 ether);

  

    // Place a bid

    uint256 bidIndex = auction.bid(100000000000 ether, 1000000000000);

  

    // Stop acting as bidder

    vm.stopPrank();

  

    // Advance time to ensure the auction is expired

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days + 1);

  

    // End the auction

    vm.prank(pool);

    auction.endAuction();

    // Set up the malicious actor

    vm.startPrank(bidder);

  

    // Mint tokens for the attacker and place a malicious bid

    weth.mint(bidder, 1000000000000 ether);

    usdc.approve(address(auction), 1000000000000 ether);

    //auction.bid(100000000000 ether, 1000000000000);

  

    // Attempt to exploit claimBid() with the malicious token

    try auction.claimBid(bidIndex) {

        // revert("Exploit should have failed");

    } catch {

        // Verify that the claimBid() function failed as expected

    }

  

    // Stop acting as the attacker

    vm.stopPrank();

}
```

### Mitigation

**Recommended Fix:** Use `safeTransfer` from OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library to ensure proper handling of token transfer reverts:

```solidity
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

function claimBid(uint256 bidIndex) auctionExpired auctionSucceeded whenNotPaused external {
    Bid storage bidInfo = bids[bidIndex];
    if (bidInfo.bidder != msg.sender) revert NothingToClaim();
    if (bidInfo.claimed) revert AlreadyClaimed();

    bidInfo.claimed = true;
    IERC20(sellReserveToken).safeTransfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);

    emit BidClaimed(bidIndex, bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
}
```
