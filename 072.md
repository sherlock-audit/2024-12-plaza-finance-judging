# Precision loss in `BondToken::getIndexedUserAmount` function due to division by `SHARES_DECIMALS` in every iteration.

### Summary

`BondToken::getIndexedUserAmount` is used to get shares owned by an user. In the function the shares is calculated as -

```js
    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }
```
the toBaseUnit does following -

```js
  function toBaseUnit(uint256 amount, uint8 decimals) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return amount / (10 ** decimals);
  }
```
But this approach can lead to, precision loss, as the division is done for each iteration instead of whole.

for example consider a loop of 2 iteration only -

**1st iteration**

balance = 105555
globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[0].sharesPerToken = 2000

`shares = (109999*2000)/ 10**6 = 2199`

**2nd iteration**

balance = 105555
globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[1].sharesPerToken = 4000

`shares = 2199 + (109999*4000)/ 10**6  = 2199 + 4399 = 6598`

If the final product is divide by the shares then the precession loss will be comparatively less.

i.e.

`[(109999*2000) + (109999*4000)]/10**6 = 6599`

It can be clearly seen there is loss of 1 unit.

As for the above the amount taken are very small and only of 2 iterations, but in real life BOND_ETH has 18 decimals and the length of loop could be very large, in that case the precision loss could be pretty high.

**Another analogy** -

current architecture - `1.7/1 +1.4/1 = 2`
if divided the whole - `[1.7 + 1.4]/1 = 3`

Leading to loss by 1 uint.
This analogy could also be applied. 

### Root Cause

Division of all elements by `SHARES_DECIMALS` for each iteration of for loop.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Can lead to less number of shares calculation for user.
2. The share of an user is stored in a mapping `userAssets[user]`.
3. In `Distributer::claim` the shares of an user is fetched via the function
```js
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
```
4. as the updated `userAssets[user]` is less as it should be due to precession, the user will claim less reward.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Avoid dividing for each iteration of loop, instead divide the fincal product by `SHARES_DECIMAL` something like -

```js
    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken);
    }
    return shares.toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
```
