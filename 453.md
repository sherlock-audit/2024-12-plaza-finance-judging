# Incorrect dp scaling for marketRate will cause lose to other users if bond market price is low

### Summary

When withdrawing bond tokens the amount received when redeeming is supposed to be capped at the market price. The issue is that when calculating the market rate, it is scaled to the chainlink oracle dp rather than PRECISION dp. As a result the redemption rate will be incorrect and the tokens will redeem for too much. This bypasses an intended safety mechanism that ensures the market rate remains pegged. In this case the pool is supposed to retain excess value from users who are withdrawing to maintain collateralization. Failure of this mechanism causes damages to leverage users as value is not properly maintained.

### Root Cause

[Pool.sol#L449](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L449) incorrectly scales to oracleDecimals rather than PRECISION

### Internal preconditions

None

### External preconditions

Bond market rate is less than $100

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The pool pays out too much reserve token negatively impacting leverage token holders

### POC

Tests for all vulnerabilities can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/IAm0x52/05589415ce45af83aa4f7a5f63afbf45).

Insert the following test into Pool.t.sol

    function testIncorrectScalingDP() public {
        //test setup
        Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);
        Token cToken = Token(params.couponToken);

        Pool.TokenType bondTokenType = Pool.TokenType(0);

        rToken.mint(governance, 1e20);
        vm.prank(governance);
        rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 1e20);

        string memory salt = "test";
        PoolFactory.PoolParams memory _params = params;
        
        // create pool
        vm.prank(governance);
        Pool _pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(_params, 1e20, 1e20, 1e20, "", salt, "", "", false));

        // Deploy the mock price feed for bond token
        mockPriceFeed = new MockPriceFeed();

        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        OracleFeeds(oracleFeedsContract).setPriceFeed(address(_pool.bondToken()), address(0), address(mockPriceFeed), 1 days);

        mockPriceFeed.setMockPrice(90 * int256(CHAINLINK_DECIMAL_PRECISION), uint8(CHAINLINK_DECIMAL));
        vm.stopPrank();

        rToken.mint(user, 1e21);

        vm.startPrank(user);
        rToken.approve(address(_pool), type(uint256).max);

        uint amount = _pool.create(bondTokenType, 1e18, 0);
        amount = _pool.redeem(bondTokenType, amount, 0);

        // user should lose 10% due to market price for bond being 90 but they don't
        console.log(amount);
    }

    Output:

    [PASS] testIncorrectScalingDP() (gas: 2229383)
    Logs:
        1000000000000000000

In the test above the user should lose 10% of their value because the market rate is $90 but they don't

### Mitigation

Scale to `PRECISION` rather than `oracleDecimals`
