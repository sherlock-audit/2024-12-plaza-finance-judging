# USDC Blacklisting or Proxy Failure Will Cause Denial of Service for Bid Removal

### Summary

The ability of USDC to blacklist addresses or the failure of a proxy contract implementation will cause a denial of service for bidders as the safeTransfer call will revert when the bidder is blacklisted or the proxy contract becomes non-functional.

### Root Cause

in `auction::_removeBid` function https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L325 line the contract is sending coupon token to bidder. The function is likely to be often called in `auction::bid` function. If bidder is in blacklist of particular token that is transferred here, the `bid` function will be blocked for any user, causing a DOS issue

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Any user should try to bid, when blocked bidder has the lowest bid

### External Pre-conditions

1. The USDC contract needs to blacklist the bidder's address externally, rendering the safeTransfer call invalid.
2. The proxy token contract's external implementation needs to be upgraded or modified to a broken state, causing the safeTransfer function to fail.

### Attack Path

1. The USDC contract or another token contract blacklists the bidderâ€™s address, preventing token transfers to that address.
3.  A bidder creates a new bid.

### Impact

The _removeBid function fails, leaving the bid unremoved and creating a denial of service for all subsequent users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

give possibility to remove last bidder in another way and function
