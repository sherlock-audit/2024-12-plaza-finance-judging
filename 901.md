# When Redeeming `BondToken`, Calculation of `collateralLevel` is Unreasonable

### Summary

When redeeming `BondToken`, the `collateralLevel` is calculated as the expected `collateralLevel` after the redemption at a price of 100. This approach is unreasonable; instead, the `collateralLevel` should reflect the current state of the Pool.

### Root Cause

When redeeming `BondToken`, the [getRedeemAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/tree/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L498) function calculates the `collateralLevel` as the expected `collateralLevel` after the redemption at a price of 100. The redemption price is then based on this expected `collateralLevel`, which is unfair.

For example, if the current `collateralLevel` is `101%` and `BondToken` holders redeem almost all their tokens, leaving just 1 wei, the expected `collateralLevel` could exceed `120%`. This would allow them to redeem at a price of 100, leaving a very small TVL in the pool. Consequently, `LeverageToken` holders would incur significant losses since `20%` of the original TVL was allocated to them. This scenario could trigger a redemption race between both `BondToken` and `LeverageToken` holders, ultimately jeopardizing the protocolâ€™s stability.

```solidity
      function getRedeemAmount(
        ...
        
        uint256 collateralLevel;
        if (tokenType == TokenType.BOND) {
498       collateralLevel = ((tvl - (depositAmount * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION) / ((bondSupply - depositAmount) * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
        ...
        
        uint256 redeemRate;
        if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
          redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
        } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
          redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
        } else {
          redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
        }

        if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
          redeemRate = marketRate;
        }
        
        // Calculate and return the final redeem amount
        return ((depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) / ethPrice) / PRECISION;
      }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

The redeem price of `BondToken` is miscalculated, leading to potential instability and failure of the protocol.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Avoid using the EXPECTED `collateralLevel` for calculations. Instead, base it on the current `collateralLevel`.
