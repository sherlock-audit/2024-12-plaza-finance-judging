# The BalancerOracleAdapter contract incorrectly assumes that all tokens and prices are using 18 decimals

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerOracleAdapter.sol#L95C3-L119C4

USDC uses 6 decimals.
The contract assumes that all tokens and prices are using 18 decimals, as per Balancer's conventions and the expectations of the FixedPoint library used for arithmetic operations.
When a token like USDC, with 6 decimals, is used without proper adjustment, the calculations in the contract become inaccurate.

### Root Cause

  function latestRoundData()
    external
    view
    returns (uint80, int256, uint256, uint256, uint80){
    IBalancerV2WeightedPool pool = IBalancerV2WeightedPool(poolAddress);
    VaultReentrancyLib.ensureNotInVaultContext(IVault(pool.getVault()));
    (IERC20[] memory tokens,,) = IVault(pool.getVault()).getPoolTokens(pool.getPoolId());
    
    //get weights
    uint256[] memory weights = pool.getNormalizedWeights(); // 18 dec fractions
    uint256[] memory prices = new uint256[](tokens.length);
    uint8 oracleDecimals;
    for(uint8 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
      oracleDecimals = getOracleDecimals(address(tokens[i]), USD);
      prices[i] = getOraclePrice(address(tokens[i]), USD).normalizeAmount(oracleDecimals, decimals); // balancer math works with 18 dec
    }


    uint256 fairUintUSDPrice = _calculateFairUintPrice(prices, weights, pool.getInvariant(), pool.getActualSupply());


    if (fairUintUSDPrice > uint256(type(int256).max)) {
      revert PriceTooLargeForIntConversion();
    }


    return (uint80(0), int256(fairUintUSDPrice), block.timestamp, block.timestamp, uint80(0));
  }

The comment suggests that decimals is set to 18, aligning with Balancer's expected 18-decimal fixed-point format.
The normalizeAmount function adjusts the price from oracleDecimals to decimals, but it does not account for the token's own decimal places (e.g., USDC's 6 decimals).

The prices are being normalized to 18 decimals.
However, the token balances and amounts used in calculations (like weights, invariant, totalBPTSupply) are assumed to be in 18 decimals.
For USDC, which uses 6 decimals, the amounts are in 6 decimals unless adjusted. When the price (in 18 decimals) is used with token amounts (in 6 decimals), the mismatch leads to incorrect calculations in the _calculateFairUintPrice function.

Example:
Let's assume the pool contains USDC and WETH (18 decimals).
USDC/USD Chainlink oracle typically has 8 decimals.
WETH/USD Chainlink oracle typically has 8 decimals.

Retrieving and Normalizing Prices:
Oracle Price: Suppose the oracle returns 1e8 (representing $1 with 8 decimals).
Oracle Decimals: 8

Using normalizeAmount:

prices[i] = getOraclePrice(address(USDC), USD).normalizeAmount(8, 18);
Since fromDecimals (8) < toDecimals (18), the function multiplies:


prices[i] = amount * (10 ** (18 - 8)) = 1e8 * 1e10 = 1e18
Result: The USDC price is normalized to 1e18.

Handling Token Amounts
The contract does not adjust the USDC token amounts (balances, weights) to 18 decimals.
Represented in 6 decimals (e.g., a balance of 100 USDC is 1e8 in 6 decimals).

Calculating the Fair Price
In _calculateFairUintPrice:

uint256 priceWeightPower = FixedPoint.ONE;
for(uint8 i = 0; i < prices.length; i ++) {
  priceWeightPower = priceWeightPower.mulDown(
    prices[i].divDown(weights[i]).powDown(weights[i])
  );
}
uint256 fairPrice = invariant.mulDown(priceWeightPower).divDown(totalBPTSupply);
The calculations assume that prices[i], weights[i], invariant, and totalBPTSupply are all in 18-decimal fixed-point format.
Since the USDC token amounts are in 6 decimals, weights[i] derived from these amounts are not correctly scaled to 18 decimals, causing the calculation to be off.

The mismatch in decimals leads to an incorrect value of priceWeightPower.
The final fairPrice computed is incorrect.

### Impact

When the price (in 18 decimals) is used with token amounts (in 6 decimals), the mismatch leads to incorrect calculations in the _calculateFairUintPrice function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Convert token amounts (balances, weights) to 18 decimals before using them in calculations.
