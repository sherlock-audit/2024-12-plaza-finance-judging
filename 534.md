# Insufficient validation of Chainlink data feeds

### Summary

Current implementation of Retrieval of the latest price from the oracle in `OracleReader.sol` doesn't validate for the minAnswer/maxAnswer

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L68
Chainlink still has feeds that uses the min/maxAnswer to limit the range of values and hence in case of a price crash, incorrect price will be used to value the assets allowing user's to exploit this incorrectness.

### Internal Pre-conditions
