# Auction Contract Fails to Handle ERC20 Transfer Errors Leading to Irreversible Loss of Reserve Tokens for Bidders

### Summary

The lack of SafeERC20 usage in `Auction.sol#L362` will cause permanent loss of reserve tokens for successful bidders as failed ERC20 transfers will irrevocably mark bids as claimed while leaving users unrewarded

### Root Cause

**In [`Auction.sol#L362`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L362) the `transfer` function is used without verifying its success status**, allowing bids to be irrevocably marked as claimed even when ERC20 token transfers fail. While the contract uses `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` for handling `buyCouponToken` transfers in other functions (e.g., `bid`), this critical path for reserve token transfers lacks equivalent safety checks, creating inconsistent error handling for ERC20 operations.

```solidity
  function claimBid(uint256 bidIndex) auctionExpired auctionSucceeded whenNotPaused external {
    Bid storage bidInfo = bids[bidIndex];
    if (bidInfo.bidder != msg.sender) revert NothingToClaim();
    if (bidInfo.claimed) revert AlreadyClaimed();

    bidInfo.claimed = true;
@>  IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);

    emit BidClaimed(bidIndex, bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Auction must reach `SUCCEEDED` state** - The auction completes successfully (total bids meet/exceed pool sale limit and coupon amount)
2. **Non-reverting ERC20 token in use** - The `sellReserveToken` (e.g., reserve asset like ETH/USDC wrapper) implements ERC20's `transfer` to return `false` on failure instead of reverting

### External Pre-conditions

1. **Token contract experiences transfer failure** - External conditions cause `transfer()` to fail (e.g., token contract pauses, bidder uses blacklisted address, insufficient contract balance)


### Attack Path

1. **User wins auction bid** - Auction succeeds, user's bid remains in accepted bids list after auction ends
2. **User claims bid** - User calls `claimBid(bidIndex)` when auction is in `SUCCEEDED` state
3. **Transfer fails silently** - `IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer()` returns `false` (e.g., due to token contract pause), but error is unhandled
4. **State corrupted permanently** - Bid marked `claimed = true` despite failed transfer, locking user out of retries

### Impact

**Successful bidders suffer permanent loss of their entitled reserve tokens when using non-reverting ERC20 implementations**, as failed transfers irreversibly lock their claim status. For example:
- If `sellReserveToken.transfer()` fails (e.g., token contract paused), users lose 100% of their `buyReserveAmount` reserve tokens
- Attackers gain nothing (non-exploitable), but protocol users face direct fund loss due to state corruption

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the unsafe `transfer` with `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` in `claimBid`:

```diff
// (Auction.sol#L362)
-IERC20(sellReserveToken).transfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
+IERC20(sellReserveToken).safeTransfer(bidInfo.bidder, bidInfo.buyReserveAmount);
```
