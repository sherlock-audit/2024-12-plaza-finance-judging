# Incorrect Condition for Starting New Auction in startAuction Function in Pool.sol#L535 Leading to Auction Delays

### Summary

In `Pool.sol#L535`, the condition for starting a new auction in the `startAuction` function is incorrect. The current condition `require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());` checks if the previous auction time plus the distribution period and auction duration is greater than the current time. According to the contract protocol, a new auction should start after the previous auction has ended and the distribution period is completed. However, this condition can prevent a new auction from starting if it is not initiated in time, as `lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp` will fail unless the `auctionPeriod` is adjusted.

According to the protocol rules, the condition should be changed from `require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod >= block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());` to `require(lastDistribution + auctionPeriod < block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());`.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the new auction is not started in time, when `lastDistribution + distributionPeriod + auctionPeriod < block.timestamp`, the new auction will not be able to start unless the `auctionPeriod` is adjusted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation



```solidity
  function startAuction() external whenNotPaused() {
    // Check if distribution period has passed
    require(lastDistribution + distributionPeriod < block.timestamp, DistributionPeriodNotPassed());

    // Check if auction period hasn't passed
+   require(lastDistribution  + auctionPeriod < block.timestamp, AuctionPeriodPassed());
    //code........
    }
```
