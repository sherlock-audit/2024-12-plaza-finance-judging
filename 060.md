# Potential Token Transfer Failure in _removeBid Function


## Summary
The `_removeBid` function in the Auction contract uses `safeTransfer` for token transfers without proper failure handling. If a user is blacklisted (e.g., in USDC on Base chain) after placing a bid, any attempt to remove their bid will fail due to the transfer reverting. This causes the entire `_removeBid` function to revert, effectively creating a Denial of Service (DOS) condition where the bid cannot be removed and the auction's functionality may be blocked.

## Vulnerability Details
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L298-L331
In the `_removeBid` function:
```solidity
function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
    // ... bid removal logic ...
    
    address bidder = bidToRemove.bidder;
    uint256 buyReserveAmount = bidToRemove.buyReserveAmount;
    uint256 sellCouponAmount = bidToRemove.sellCouponAmount;
    currentCouponAmount -= sellCouponAmount;
    totalSellReserveAmount -= buyReserveAmount;

    // This transfer will revert if bidder is blacklisted
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);

    emit BidRemoved(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);

    delete bids[bidIndex];
    bidCount--;
}
```

The vulnerability exists because:
1. The function relies on a direct `safeTransfer` call that will revert if the transfer fails
2. If a user is blacklisted after placing their bid, any attempt to remove their bid will fail
3. This creates a permanent DOS condition as the bid cannot be removed
4. The issue is particularly concerning for tokens like USDC on Base chain that maintain blacklists

## Impact
- **Denial of Service**: If a bidder gets blacklisted, their bid becomes "stuck" in the system and cannot be removed
- **Auction Disruption**: Could block critical auction operations that depend on bid removal

## Tools Used
- Manual code review

## Recommendations
Implement a try-catch mechanism with pending refunds:

```solidity
function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
    Bid storage bidToRemove = bids[bidIndex];
    uint256 nextIndex = bidToRemove.nextBidIndex;
    uint256 prevIndex = bidToRemove.prevBidIndex;

    // Update linked list pointers
    if (prevIndex == 0) {
        highestBidIndex = nextIndex;
    } else {
        bids[prevIndex].nextBidIndex = nextIndex;
    }

    if (nextIndex == 0) {
        lowestBidIndex = prevIndex;
    } else {
        bids[nextIndex].prevBidIndex = prevIndex;
    }

    address bidder = bidToRemove.bidder;
    uint256 buyReserveAmount = bidToRemove.buyReserveAmount;
    uint256 sellCouponAmount = bidToRemove.sellCouponAmount;
    currentCouponAmount -= sellCouponAmount;
    totalSellReserveAmount -= buyReserveAmount;

    try IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount) {
        emit BidRemoved(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);
    } catch {
        pendingRefunds[bidder] += sellCouponAmount;
        emit BidRemovedPendingRefund(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);
    }

    delete bids[bidIndex];
    bidCount--;
}
```

Additional recommendations:
1. Add a `claimPendingRefund` function for users to claim their refunds later
2. Consider implementing a maximum cap on pending refunds per address
3. Add events to track pending refund status
4. Add documentation about the refund mechanism in the contract
