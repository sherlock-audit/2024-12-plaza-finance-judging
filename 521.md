# incorrect price for negative ticks due to lack of rounding down


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L109

### PoC

The function latestRoundData is used to get twap price tick using ICLPool.observe.selector which is then used to calculate the int24 tick.

The problem is that in case if (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) is negative, the tick should be rounded down as it's done in the OracleLibrary from uniswap.
https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/697c2474757ea89fec12a4e6db16a574fe259610/contracts/libraries/OracleLibrary.sol#L16-L41

As result, in case if (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0])is negative and (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) % secondsAgo != 0, then returned tick will be bigger then it should be, hence incorrect prices would be used

### Impact

incorrect prices would be used and this causes marketRate compute wrongly which has effect on redeem rate
```solidity
    if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
      redeemRate = marketRate;
    }
```     

### Mitigation

Round down the int24 tick:
```solidity
int56 tickCumulativesDelta = tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0];
int24 tick = int24((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int56(uint56(twapInterval)))
if (tickCumulativesDelta < 0 && (tickCumulativesDelta % secondsAgo != 0)) tick--;
uint160 getSqrtTwapX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(tick)
```
