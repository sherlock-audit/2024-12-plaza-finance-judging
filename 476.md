# Using the current Bond Token supply to determine the size of the auction must be discouraged. Instead, the size should be based on the Bond Token supply at the start of the period minus the redeemed tokens.

### Summary

`Pool.startAuction()` uses the Bond Token supply at the time of the call to decide how many coupon tokens should be gathered in the auction. However, it is expected that these coupon tokens will be received in exchange for reserve tokens, which are anticipated to generate yield over time (increasing their value). The later these reserve tokens are used to mint bond/leverage tokens, the less yield will be generated. This will sooner or later lead to an unhealthy collateral level.

### Impact

**HIGH**

Current approach will completely break core mechanisms of the protocol over time, leading collateral level under 120%

### PoC

1. 1,000 bond tokens and 200 leverage tokens are minted for 100 wstETH at a valuation of 4,000 USDC.
2. Day 89: Bob mints 10 bond tokens for 1 wstETH.
3. Day 90:
    * wstETH is now valued at 5,000 USDC and has generated 1% yield from the initial 100 wstETH, but only 0.01% from the 1 wstETH deposited by Bob.
    * A new auction begins. 
    * Bob's bond tokens are also entitled to 2.5 USDC each.
    * After the auction succeeds, Bob redeems his bond tokens for wstETH.

If this process repeats over time, the protocol will eventually end up in an unhealthy situation with the collateral level falling below 120%.

### Mitigation

The current implementation should be revised to consider the bond token supply at the beginning of each period and to reward only bond token holders who retain their bonds throughout the holding period.
