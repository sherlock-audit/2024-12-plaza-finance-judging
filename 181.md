# preDeposit system can be gamed to gain more shares

Users can game the system by depositing full amount of reserveCap, blocking other users from contributing to the pool, and then withdraw the excess amount they never intended to deposit just before the deposit period end time to attain more (or all) shares than they are entitled to.

### Details

During the deposit period, users can freely deposit and withdraw to the PreDeposit contract for the pool. There is a reserveCap that puts a maximum limit of tokens that can be deposited to the system. Once that cap is reached, no one can deposit further. Anyone can game the system by filling the cap and withdrawing the the excess just before the deposit period ends, thus receive either all, or way more shares than they normally should. 

The attack path goes as follows:

`_deposit` function checks if the reserveCap is reached or not via this line `if (reserveAmount >= reserveCap) revert DepositCapReached();`

Attacker fills the reserveCap, say 50 ether by depositing all of it. In this attack path, they need not to deposit all the cap themselves, maybe they will be late to do so, and will deposit only the majority of the cap, still, they will end up gaming the system by inflating their shares (alongside with those who also deposited and now lucky thanks to the attacker).

Since reserveCap is filled, no one can deposit further, because the purpose of the preDeposit in the eyes of the protocol is completed: Gathering the necessary amount of tokens for preDeposit.

They wait just before the deposit end time, and just before it ends, they withdraw all the excess tokens they never intended to deposit from the contract. 

Let’s say that the attacker was early and they got to fill all the reserve cap by themselves, they deposited 50 ether, the cap was 50 ether, so now no one can deposit further.

Just before the deposit period ends, they withdrew 49 ether, leaving only 1 ether deposited. Their shares will be calculated as follows via the claim function:

`uint256 userBondShare = (bondAmount * userBalance) / reserveAmount;`

so,

userBondShare= (50 ether * 1 ether) / 1 ether ⇒ 50 ether

Attacker got all the shares for themselves by paying only 1 ether.

_Works the same for leverage token._

**NOTE** that the following line in _deposit function does not protect from this attack path

```solidity
        // if user would like to put more than available in cap, fill the rest up to cap and add that to reserves
        if (reserveAmount + amount >= reserveCap) {
            amount = reserveCap - reserveAmount;
        }
```

This only works if the reserveCap is not reached yet, and if someone deposits an amount that would pass the cap. 

**Also note that** there are a couple of admin actions that can be used in an attempt to fight against this attack path, which I’ll outline now, but none of them manage to safeguard against it. 

The admin can increase the cap via increaseReserveCap, which, the attacker will just fill again. 

Then, the admin can increase the cap to uint256 max, which will make the idea of having a cap useless, will break the system logic.

Or, the admin can pause the contract near to the end of deposit period, but then, the attacker might just not fill the cap, and leave some amount for other users, which will mean that when the admin pauses the contract, they’ll effectively pause the deposit functionality for all other users.

So, none of the actions the admin can take fights against the path successfully. 

### Impact

Attacker can get all the shares or a lot of shares by depositing little amounts.

### POC
Here's a quick and dirty POC that shows user1 can fill the cap, so that user2 cannot even deposit 1 eth amount, and when the user1 waits for the last moment to withdraw all the tokens they never intended to deposit, given that they timed correctly and no one could bid after they withdrew, they get all the shares of both bond and lev tokens.

BOND_AMOUNT and LEVERAGE_AMOUNT are both 50 ether.

Paste this and run in the PreDeposit.t.sol test file

```solidity
    function test_system_gamed() public {
        (, address bondToken, address lToken) = deployFakePool();

        // Create pool
        vm.startPrank(governance);
        preDeposit.setBondAndLeverageAmount(BOND_AMOUNT, LEVERAGE_AMOUNT);

        // fake bond/lev to predeposit contract, simulating a pool created
        BondToken(bondToken).mint(address(preDeposit), 10000 ether);
        LeverageToken(lToken).mint(address(preDeposit), 10000 ether);

        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        reserveToken.mint(user1, 150 ether);
        reserveToken.approve(address(preDeposit), 150 ether);
        preDeposit.deposit(100 ether); //deposit the max amount
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user2);
        reserveToken.mint(user1, 150 ether);
        reserveToken.approve(address(preDeposit), 150 ether);
        vm.expectRevert(); //can't even deposit 1 eth amount
        preDeposit.deposit(1 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 6 days + 23 hours + 59 minutes); // wait just before the period ends

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        preDeposit.withdraw(99 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days); //period ends

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        preDeposit.claim();
        //assert users bond and lev token balances are correct

        assertEq(BondToken(bondToken).balanceOf(user1), BOND_AMOUNT);
        assertEq(LeverageToken(lToken).balanceOf(user1), LEVERAGE_AMOUNT);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Recommendation

You might consider adding a safeguard timelock for withdraws. Say, when it’s near the end, no one can withdraw, they only can deposit. 

Or, you can add a check in the claim function that makes sure that the cap was reached, so that the attacker couldn’t withdraw the excess they never intended to contribute.
