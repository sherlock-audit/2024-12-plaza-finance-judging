# HIGH - DDOS Vulnerability in joinBalancerAndPlaza

### Summary

The `joinBalancerAndPlaza` function is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DDOS) attack due to an unbounded loop in the `joinBalancerPool` function. An attacker can exploit this by passing excessively large arrays for assets and `maxAmountsIn,` causing high gas consumption and making the function unusable for legitimate users.

### Root Cause

the choice in the unbounded loop in joinBalancerPool is a mistake and can be manipulated by an Attacker to ddos the Plaza protocol in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L42-L90

`for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
    IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
    IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]);
}
` 

Problem: No limit is enforced on the size of the assets and maxAmountsIn arrays.
Exploitation: An attacker can submit a transaction with excessively large arrays, forcing the loop to iterate a large number of times and consuming all available gas.

### Impact

### Severity: High

**Category:** Denial of Service (DDOS)

The vulnerability allows attackers to:

Exhaust gas by submitting large inputs, rendering the `joinBalancerPool` function inaccessible.
Cause service disruption for other users, degrading the protocol's usability.
Potentially impact other protocol functions if gas exhaustion leads to unexpected failures.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

### Recommended Mitigations

1. Limit Array Size Enforce a maximum size for assets and maxAmountsIn arrays:
`require(assets.length <= MAX_ASSETS, "Too many assets");
require(maxAmountsIn.length == assets.length, "Mismatched array lengths");
Set Minimum Input Amount Reject transactions with small or zero amounts:`
`require(maxAmountsIn[i] > MIN_INPUT_AMOUNT, "Amount too low");`
2. Batch Processing Encourage smaller batches of transactions for large inputs.
3. Gas Threshold Checks Validate that enough gas remains for processing:
`require(gasleft() > MIN_GAS_THRESHOLD, "Insufficient gas");
Rate Limiting Implement rate limits to prevent repeated spam transactions.`
