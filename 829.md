# DOS in the bid function

### Summary

An malicious user can block `bid()` functions for other users by invoking DOS before the auction ends 

### Root Cause

When the auction starts, everyone can bid for USDC (coupone) and get wstETH (reserveToken). Bids are limited to the number of slots. If the new bid is higher than the lowest bid and all slots are already occupied, the lowest bid is removed from the slot and the tokens are sent back to the owner of the lowest bid. Since in the beginning the user has to bid in USDC, in case his bid is removed, the contract will send his USDC back to him. the contract does not check if the bidder can be in USDC's blacklist and thus call DOS every time.

### Internal Pre-conditions

 The attacker must call the [`bid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L125) function in the auction contract 

### External Pre-conditions

An attacker must commit an illegal act from his address to be blacklisted by the USDC

### Attack Path

1. The malicious user must call the bid() function in the auction contract

2. The malicious must perform illegal actions from his address, e.g. start interacting with sanctioned addresses or fraudulent addresses. 


### Impact

 The malicious user calls the `bid()` function several times with the smallest allowable input. Thereby occupying a larger number of slots 

After the call is successful and his bids are placed in the slots, the malicious user commits illegal actions in order to be blacklisted by USDC. 

After that users will not be able to bid, because during the `bid()` function call the attacker's bid must be removed, but because during the transfer of USDC back to the attacker, in the `_removeBid` function, there is always a **revert**. 

Thus, the malicious bidder can constantly win the auction and get the reserveToken without competing with other bidders. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a blacklist check, and in case the user is blacklisted and their bid needs to be deleted, then delete the bid without passing USDC
