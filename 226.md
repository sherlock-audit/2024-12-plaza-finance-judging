# Incorrect `PoolSaleLimit` logic

### Summary

When an auction is started, bidders deposit coupon tokens(USDC) in exchange for reserve tokens(WETH). When `endAuction` is called, it validates if too much reserver token has been sold by checking through `poolSaleLimit`.

However, current implemtation requires `poolSaleLimit` to be more than 90% of the pool, which is very wrong and weird.

When usually `collateralLevel > 1.2`, 1 BondToken price is 100 USDC, and the pool holds `100 USDC * bondSupply` worth of reserve tokens.
In every distribution period, `bondSupply * 2.5 USDC` amount of coupons are required, thus sell a portion of reserve tokens, which is approximately 2.5% of the pool reserve.

While usually 2.5% of reserve tokens are required to be sold, allowing 90% to be sold is definitely an incorrect implementation.

### Root Cause

On [Pool.sol#L172-L183](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L172-L183), `setPoolSaleLimit` function is not correctly implemented, and `MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` constant definition on the line [Pool.sol#L39](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L39) is not correct.

It has to be `MAX_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` and with appropriate percentage.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A distribution period ends and then an auction starts.

### External Pre-conditions

Users bid for reserve tokens, requesting upto `poolSaleLimit` which is 90% of whole reserve.

### Attack Path

- Assume, the pool has 1 WETH and 20 BondTokens, 1 WETH = 3000 USDC, collateralLevel = 1.5
- `poolSaleLimit` is set to 90, which represents 90% of reserve tokens of the pool.
- An auction is about to start, required total coupon amount is `20 BondTokens * 2.5 USDC = 50 USDC`.
- Bidders fill the auction, and it ends by exchanging `50 USDC` with `0.9 WETH = 2700 USDC`.
- As a result, the pool has only `0.1 WETH` remaining, leaving it to insolvent.

### Impact

Reserve tokens of the pool can be drained because of incorrect handling of `poolSaleLimit` implementation.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Instead of `MIN_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`, it should introduce `MAX_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` with appropriate percentage.
