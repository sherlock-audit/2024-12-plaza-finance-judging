# Delayed Pool.distribute() call leads to insufficient coupon tokens in Distributor, leaving excess tokens stuck in the pool

### Summary

When `Pool.distribute()` is not called in time before the start of a new auction period, the coupon tokens intended for distribution to users are not transferred from the `Pool` to the `Distributor`. This results in insufficient coupon tokens for user claims, while the excess tokens remain stuck in the pool.

This creates a fairness issue where:

1. Early claimers drain the limited tokens in the `Distributor`, leaving late claimers unable to claim their rightful shares.
2. Excess coupon tokens in the Pool cannot be accessed or allocated effectively, reducing the protocolâ€™s efficiency.

### Root Cause

1. Delayed Execution of Pool.distribute():

- Pool.distribute() is permissionless and relies on external actors to call it. If this call is delayed until after a new auction starts, tokens for the previous period remain stuck in the Pool.
2. Untransferred Tokens:

- When `distribute()` is not executed in time, the tokens intended for `Distributor` allocation are never transferred, creating a deficit in the `couponAmountToDistribute` available for claims.
3. Shares Calculation Remains Intact:

- `sharesPerToken` remains unchanged because it is determined by the configuration at the start of the auction. However, insufficient coupon tokens cause late claimers to lose out despite their valid shares.
4. Excess Tokens Remain Stuck:

Coupon tokens for failed distributions are not rolled over, and excess tokens stay in the `Pool` without being allocated to the `Distributor`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction Period Ends:
- A new auction starts before `Pool.distribute()` is called for the previous period.
2. Tokens Remain in the Pool:
- The `buyCouponToken` is transferred to the Pool in `Auction.endAuction()` but not allocated to the `Distributor` due to the delayed `distribute()` call.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Permissionless Nature of `distribute()`:
- `Pool.distribute()` relies on external actors (typically bond users) to trigger the transfer of tokens.
2. Manual Governance Actions:
- Shortened distribution periods with smaller `sharesPerToken` values (both are changeable to adopt a new set of approach) increase the likelihood of delayed distribute() calls due to less incentivized bond users.


### Attack Path

This is not a direct attack vector but a functional design flaw:

1. An auction ends successfully, and the `buyCouponToken` is transferred to the `Pool`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L346

```solidity
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
```
2. `Pool.distribute()` is not called before the next auction starts, leaving the tokens unallocated in the Pool.
3. When `distribute()` is eventually called, `couponAmountToDistribute` is assigned `totalBuyCouponAmount()` associated with the latest auction.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L593-L595

```solidity
    // Period is increased when auction starts, we want to distribute for the previous period
    uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = Auction(auctions[previousPeriod]).totalBuyCouponAmount();
```
4. Early claimers deplete the available `couponAmountToDistribute`. And, late claimers are unable to claim their rightful shares, even though excess tokens remain stuck in the Pool.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L107

```solidity
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
```

### Impact

1. Unfair Distribution:
- Early claimers deplete the limited `couponAmountToDistribute` in the `Distributor`, leaving late claimers unable to access their shares.
2. Excess Tokens Stuck in the Pool:
- Coupon tokens intended for distribution remain unallocated in the Pool, reducing protocol efficiency.
3. User Distrust:
- Late claimers may lose trust in the protocol due to the perceived unfairness in token distribution.

The impact is deemed high, but given the low likelihood of this happening, a medium severity is assigned in this report.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Automatically call `Pool.distribute()` at the end of each auction in `Auction.endAuction()` to ensure tokens are transferred to the `Distributor` immediately after the auction succeeds.
