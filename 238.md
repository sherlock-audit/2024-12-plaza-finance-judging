# leverage tokens can’t be redeemed when  bondSupply = 0.

### Summary

See the  function getCreateAmount/ function getRedeemAmount(pool.sol) where leverage/bond tokens can’t be redeemed and  leverage/bond tokens can’t be minted if bondSupply == 0. So there may come a scenario when  all bond tokens  are redeemed before leverage token from the pool,in this scenario leverage tokens can’t be redeemed as bondSupply = 0. As a result, reserveAmount backed by leverage token will be stuck in the pool.


### Root Cause

 leverage tokens can’t be redeemed when bondSupply = 0.


### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, before creating a pool(through  BalancerRouter), PreDeposit reserveAmount in usd = 10000, PreDeposit bondAmount(set by owner) = 60, PreDeposit leverageAmount(set by owner) = 50.

2. Afterthat,the pool is created(through  BalancerRouter) , so currently  bondAmount = 60, leverageAmount = 50.

3. Afterthat all PreDeposit users claims their bond and leverage tokens.

4. After the pool creation let’s assume, l 50 bond token and 40 leverage is minted. So  currently bondAmount = 60+50 = 110, leverageAmount = 50+40 = 90.

5. Afterthat let’s assume, all bond tokens i.e 110 bond tokens are redeemed before leverage token. Now  bondSupply = 0.

6. See the  function getCreateAmount/ function getRedeemAmount(pool.sol) where leverage/bond tokens can’t be redeemed and  leverage/bond tokens can’t be minted if bondSupply == 0.so now leverage tokens can’t be redeemed as bondSupply = 0 and leverage/bond tokens can’t be minted as bondSupply = 0.

7. As a result,  reserveAmount backed by leverage token will be stuck in the pool.also auction can’t be created for leverage tokens.

### Impact

 leverage tokens can’t be redeemed when bondSupply = 0. As a result, reserveAmount backed by leverage token will be stuck in the pool.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

make sure  leverage tokens can be redeemed when bondSupply = 0.
