# Precision loss in Pool.sol calculations due to early division operations

### Summary

Early division operations in price and TVL calculations will cause precision loss as the protocol performs division before multiplication in critical token creation and redemption functions.

### Root Cause

In Pool.sol, the calculation order in `getCreateAmount` and `getRedeemAmount` leads to precision loss:

```solidity
// TVL calculation performs division too early
uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);

// Creation rate calculated with early division
creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;
return ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol experiences precision loss in token creation and redemption calculations that could lead to zero denominators. As a result, creation and redemption transactions will revert.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restructure the calculations to perform multiplication before division.
