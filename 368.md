# When the pool is under-collateralized, it would mint more tokens than healthy collateralized state

### Summary

In the Plaza pool, user deposit reserve tokens in exchange for bond/leverage tokens. The pool's collateral rate is determined by value of reserve token in USD, to the total value of bond token (100 USD). When the pool is under-collateralized, for the same amount of reserve tokens, less bond tokens will be minted, this is to bring up and stabilize the pool a bit. However, in the current implementation, more tokens will be minted when under-collateralized.

### Root Cause

[`Pool::getCreateAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L306) determines how many Plaza tokens will be minted for the given amount of reserve tokens, and it depends on the collateral ratio:
```solidity
  function getCreateAmount(
    TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 bondSupply, 
    uint256 levSupply, 
    uint256 poolReserves, 
    uint256 ethPrice,
    uint8 oracleDecimals) public pure returns(uint256) {
    if (bondSupply == 0) {
      revert ZeroDebtSupply();
    }

    uint256 assetSupply = bondSupply;
    uint256 multiplier = POINT_EIGHT;
    if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      multiplier = POINT_TWO;
      assetSupply = levSupply;
    }

    uint256 tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
    uint256 collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE);
    uint256 creationRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;

    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE && assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }
      creationRate = (tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply;
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
      if (assetSupply == 0) {
        revert ZeroLeverageSupply();
      }

      uint256 adjustedValue = tvl - (BOND_TARGET_PRICE * bondSupply);
      creationRate = (adjustedValue * PRECISION) / assetSupply;
    }
    
    return ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals);
  }
```

We see, by default, when the pool is at a healthy state, the `creationRate` will just be `BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION`, which is 100 * 1e6 = 1e8. When the pool is under-collateral, which is to say, the `tvl/bond_value` is less than 1.2e6, `creationRate` will depend on the tvl and the total supply of target token, and times `multiplier`, which for bond token, is 0.8e6. At the end of the function, `creationRate` is used as denominator to supposedly scale down minted amount, but when under-collateralized, the multiplier is less than `PRECISION`, meaning dividing such value will actually make the value larger than before, this would mint more bond tokens, which is to bring down the collateral ratio even more.

A bit math to back up the statement:
Let's assume the price is 120 for reserve tokens, and the supply (excluding fees) will be 5000e18 wei, which means the tvl here will be 6e23. For healthy CR, there is 3000e18 bond tokens, and as bond token price is 100, the bond_tvl will be 3e23.

So the CR now is 2e6, which is over-collateralized, so the `creationRate` will just be default value, which is 1e8.

Now we consider the case for under-collateralized state, to make this happen, we change the supply of bond token to 6000e18, this makes CR to be 1e6, which is less than 1.2e6. So `creationRate` will be adjusted:
6e23 * 0.8e6 / 6e21 = 0.8e8.

At the end of function, when create amount is derived, since `creationRate` is used as denominator, so larger value will result in smaller create amount, so there would be more tokens minted when under-collateralized than normal-collateralized state, this would further dilute the CR, and make the pool stay in a bad state longer.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

As explained in the root cause section, more tokens will be minted when under-collateralized, this will make the CR of pool even worse as there will be more bond tokens minted, so CR stays low, affecting the economic of the pool.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Multiply `creationRate` instead of dividing it
