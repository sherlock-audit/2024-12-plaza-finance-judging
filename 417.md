# Reserve token blacklisting freezes pool funds

#### 1. Brief
The protocol allows the use of reserve tokens with blacklisting functionality (e.g., USDC). If the pool contract is blacklisted, all user funds become permanently inaccessible.  

#### 2. Description
**Mechanism**:  
- Tokens like USDC allow issuers to blacklist addresses, blocking transfers to/from those addresses.  
- If the pool contract (or its associated addresses) is blacklisted by the reserve token:  
  1. Users cannot deposit (`create`) or withdraw (`redeem`) funds.  
  2. All reserve tokens in the pool become permanently locked.  

**Flaw**:  
- The protocol does not check whether the reserve token has blacklisting capabilities during pool creation.  
- No emergency mechanism exists to recover funds if blacklisting occurs.  

**Example Scenario**:  
1. A pool uses USDC as its `reserveToken`.  
2. USDC issuer blacklists the pool contract due to regulatory concerns.  
3. Users cannot withdraw their USDC, resulting in total loss of funds.  

#### 3. Impact  
- **Direct Impact**: Permanent loss of all reserve tokens in the pool.  
- **Protocol Impact**: Reputational damage and potential legal action.  

#### 4. Proof of Concept (PoC)  
**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Deploy a pool with USDC as the `reserveToken`.  
2. Simulate a blacklist action on the pool address using USDCâ€™s `blacklist` function.  
3. Attempt to call `redeem` or `create`; transactions revert due to blacklisting.  

#### 5. Mitigation Steps
- Add checks during pool creation to block tokens with blacklisting functionality.  
- Implement a failsafe function for privileged roles (e.g., governance) to rescue funds if blacklisting occurs.
