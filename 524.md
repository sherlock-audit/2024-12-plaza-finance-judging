# No Auction can succeed

### Summary

An error in the check of the transferReserveToAuction function causes the call to endAuction to revert, making the auction impossible to succeed.

### Root Cause

When an auction starts, an auction contract is called, the current period is updated, and a mapping stores the address of the auction, as we can see here : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L552-L567

and here : 

```solidity 
 function increaseIndexedAssetPeriod(uint256 sharesPerToken) public onlyRole(DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused() {
    globalPool.previousPoolAmounts.push(
      PoolAmount({
        period: globalPool.currentPeriod,
        amount: totalSupply(),
        sharesPerToken: globalPool.sharesPerToken
      })
    );
    globalPool.currentPeriod++;
    globalPool.sharesPerToken = sharesPerToken;

    emit IncreasedAssetPeriod(globalPool.currentPeriod, sharesPerToken);
  }
```

However, when an auction ends successfully, the function transferReserveToAuction is called. As we can see, it checks if the auction is in the auctions mapping. The issue is that the function checks the current period, which has been updated during the call to `startAuction`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

none.

### External Pre-conditions

none.

### Attack Path

1. A user want to call endAuction for a succeeded auction and this will always revert.

### Impact

No auction can succeed

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the code to check the previous auction : 

```solidity 
 function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
   uint256 previousPeriod = currentPeriod-1;
    address auctionAddress = auctions[previousPeriod];
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```
