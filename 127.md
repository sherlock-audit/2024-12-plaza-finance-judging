# The last bondETH holder will not be able to redeem their tokens in full

### Summary

The calculation of the collateral ratio involves a division by bond supply after it is decreased by the redemption amount. In the case of the last bondETH redemption, this will lead to division by zero.

### Root Cause

In `Pool.sol:498` the collateral level is calculated by dividing reserves by bond supply after decreasing it by redemption amount ( `depositAmount`):

In the case of the last bondETH holder withdrawing, effectively `bondSupply` is equal to `depositAmount` because bondETH gets burned (decreased) on every redemption, thus this operation reverts due to division by zero, disallowing the user to redeem their bondETH tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The last bondETH holder redeems

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The last bondETH holder cannot redeem using the full amount of their bondETH tokens, meaning that redeem functionality is broken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

One of the ways to mitigate this is to mint dead/virtual shares ensuring they may never be redeemed.
