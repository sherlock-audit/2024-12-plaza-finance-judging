# The market rate feature is broken due to wrong precision

### Summary

The value fetched by the `BondOracleAdapter`, as the [`marketRate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L446-L450) is in units of "oracle decimals", but the code that uses the value expects "precision decimals". Because "oracle decimals" are expected to be (1e18) much larger than precision decimals (1e6), the market rate feature will never work.

### Root Cause

The code that fetches the market rate explicitly converts the value into `oracleDecimals`, rather than into the expected `PRECISION` decimals:
```solidity
      marketRate = getOraclePrice(address(bondToken), USD)
        .normalizeAmount(
          getOracleDecimals(address(bondToken), USD), 
          oracleDecimals // this is the decimals of the reserve token chainlink feed
        );
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A bond oracle is configured to be used in order to use a live market price for the price of bond tokens.


### External Pre-conditions

1. The market price of a bond is <$100, according to the aerodrome pool used by the `BondOracleAdapter` to fetch the market rate.

### Attack Path

1. User calls redeem and gets the full $100 rate, rather than the live market rate.

### Impact

The feature of using a market rate when it's lower than $100, is broken

### PoC

Looking at the [redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L510-L524) code:
```solidity
    return ((depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) / ethPrice) / PRECISION;
```

the decimals in use are:
`return ((common * x) * oracle / oracle / precision`

to return common, x must be precision (as is done [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L516)), but it's being passed as [oracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L446-L450)


### Mitigation

Convert the oracle value to `PRECISION`, rather than `10**oracleDecimals`
