# Attacker Can Consistently Cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) in Auctions

### Summary

The `Auction` contract enables users to `bid` for `underlying assets` (commonly Balancer LPs) using `buyCouponToken` (likely USDC) within a specific time frame. After the auction ends, any user can call `endAuction` to finalize it and begin distributing the LP tokens.

However, an attacker can consistently **create a DoS by "purchasing" a large amount of underlyingToken**. This manipulation forces the auction to end in the `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`, and the attacker subsequently receives a full refund.

### Root Cause

The issue arises because there are **no restrictions on the buyReserveAmount during bids**, allowing an attacker to bid an amount exceeding the `poolSaleLimit`.

This exploit has no negative consequences for the attacker since their funds are refunded after the auction is marked as `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`.

The attacker **can repeat this process indefinitely**, effectively **nullifying the purpose of the protocol**.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker submits a bid with a buyReserveAmount greater than the poolSaleLimit.

2. The auction ends, and its state is set to State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT.

3. The attacker reclaims their couponTokens.

### Impact

This attack enables a **permanent denial-of-service (DoS)** on deployed auctions, rendering them useless.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement restrictions on the `buyReserveAmount` that users can select during the bidding process, ensuring it cannot exceed the `poolSaleLimit`.
