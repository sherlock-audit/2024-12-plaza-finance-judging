# Precission loss in the Pool contract

### Summary

In the `getCreateAmount()` function of the `Pool` contract, when the `tvl` is being calculated, it is converted to use the `oracleDecimals`. The `tvl` is later used to calculate the `creationRate`, and because part of the precision is lost during the decimal transformation, the `creationRate` could end up being `0` in some cases, leading to a division-by-zero error.

The same issue could be observed in the `getRedeemAmount()` function, but this time when calculating the `redeemRate`.

The `getRedeemAmount()` function has an additional issue, where it does multiplication after division, which could also increase the recession loss:

```solidity
function getRedeemAmount(
    TokenType tokenType,
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 bondSupply,
    uint256 levSupply,
    uint256 poolReserves,
    uint256 ethPrice,
    uint8 oracleDecimals,
    uint256 marketRate
  ) public pure returns(uint256) {
    if (bondSupply == 0) {
      revert ZeroDebtSupply();
    }
__SNIP__
    // Calculate the redeem rate based on the collateral level and token type
    uint256 redeemRate;
    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
@>      redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION; // @audit - multiplication after divsion
    } else {
      redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
    }

__SNIP__
  }
```


### Root Cause

1. Division is done before multiplication in the `getRedeemAmount()` function, leading to precision loss.
2. TVL is converted to a base decimal before being used in the `creationRate` and `redeemRate` calculations, leading to precission loss.

### Internal Pre-conditions

For the first root cause:

1. Token redeem needs to be the `levETH` token and the collateral level needs to be `> 1.2`

For the second root cause:

1. The collateral level needs to be `<= 1.2`

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The protocol suffers precision loss when creating and redeeming plaza tokens.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Multiplication should always be performed before division to avoid loss of precision. Also, consider performing the conversion of `ethPrice` during the calculation of the create amount and redeem amount.
