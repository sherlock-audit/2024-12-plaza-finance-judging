# Transfering bond tokens between 2 addresses allows to drain distribution

### Summary

Calculation of coupon tokens to claim is based on the current user's balance and can be manipulated by transfering bond tokens between 2 addresses - thus users who owns 2 addreses can claim 2x coupon tokens.

### Root Cause

Calculation of coupon tokens to claim is based on the current user's balance and can be manipulated by transfering bond tokens between 2 addresses - thus users who owns 2 addreses can claim 2x coupon tokens.

```solidity
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    uint256 balance = bondToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod)
                              .normalizeAmount(bondToken.decimals(), IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

User must own 2 or more addresses.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Some details omitted for simplicity:
1, Amelie has 100 `BOND` on `addr1` and claims 250 coupons;
2. Amelis transfers 100 `BOND` to her `addr2` and claims 250 coupons again;

### Impact

Transfering bond tokens between 2 addresses allows to drain distribution.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It's recommended to override transfer functions to prevent transfering `BOND` between users or not to use `balanceOf()`.
