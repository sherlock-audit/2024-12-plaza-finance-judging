# The auction doesn't have a price step

### Summary

Function `Auction.bid` doesn't have a price step, which should differentiate the next bidder price significantly. This leads to 1 wei price changes in next bids and the auction loses its purpose. 

### Root Cause

In `Auction.bid` function, if the array of bids is full, the bids with the worst price are being deleted. A bidder who wants to put their bid into array, should lower his token price just for 1 wei in order to not be deleted. In the auction end, final price almost equal to initial.
