# not UX friendly auction finalization

#### 1. Brief
The [endAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L336-L350) function must be manually invoked to finalize the auction state. If not called, the auction remains in the `BIDDING` phase indefinitely, locking user funds.  

#### 2. Description
**Mechanism**:  
- Auctions have a defined `endTime` after which they should conclude.  
- The protocol relies on manual invocation of `endAuction` to transition the auction from `BIDDING` to `SUCCEEDED`/`FAILED` states.  

**Flaw**:  
- If `endAuction` is not called post-`endTime`, the auction state remains `BIDDING`.  
- Users cannot claim tokens or refunds until the state changes, leading to permanent fund lockup.  

**Example Scenario**:  
1. Auction ends at `endTime = 12:00 PM`.  
2. No participant or admin calls `endAuction`.  
3. Bidders attempt to claim tokens via `claimBid()` but fail (reverts with `AuctionFailed`).  
4. Reserve tokens remain trapped in the contract.  

#### 3. Impact 
- **Direct Impact**: Funds are locked indefinitely, until someone call `endAuction` (external function).  
- **Protocol Impact**: Loss of user confidence and operational paralysis, it is not an UX friendly step.  

#### 4. Proof of Concept (PoC)  
**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Deploy an auction with `endTime = block.timestamp + 1 hour`.  
2. Let the auction expire without calling `endAuction`.  
3. Call `claimBid()`; observe revert due to `state == BIDDING`.  

#### 5. Mitigation Steps
Automatically finalize the auction during the first post-`endTime` interaction (e.g., in `claimBid` or `claimRefund`).
