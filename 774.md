# Malicious attackers can prevent auction participants from profiting, thereby hindering the success of the auction.

### Summary

There is an issue with the `bid` function in the contract `Auction.sol`.Malicious users repeatedly purchase small amounts of Reserve at very high bids, preventing normal auction participants from profiting from the auction, leading to its failure. At this point, the attacker can recover their attack costs and launch another attack.

### Root Cause

The function (`bid`) lacks a mechanism to restrict malicious bidding, allowing attackers to exploit the `maxBids` feature to conduct their attacks.

### Attack Path

Malicious users purchase a small amount of `Reserve` at very high prices each time and repeatedly bid `maxBids` times, while ensuring that `currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount` holds true.

In this case, a normal user must pass the following checks for their bid to be valid. In other words, to ensure their bid is valid, a normal user needs to remove the attacker's bids from `mapping(uint256 => Bid) public bids`.

However, this requires the normal user to bid at a price much higher than the market price (greater than the attacker's price) to remove the attackerâ€™s bid (`leftSide > rightSide`). Such a high price causes normal users to be unable to profit from the auction, leading them not to place bids.

As a result, the condition `currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount` always holds true, ultimately causing the auction to fail (`state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD`). The attacker can then reclaim their attack costs by calling the `claimRefund` function.

### Impact

The attacker prevents normal users from profiting from the auction, which allows the auction to be manipulated by the attacker, ultimately leading to its failure.This indirectly prevents users from receiving the coupons they deserve.
