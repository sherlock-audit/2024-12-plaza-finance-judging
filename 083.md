# FrontRunning attack on auction bidding mechanism

### Summary

The transparency of the mempool and the lack of protection against transaction ordering will cause unfair removal of legitimate bids or manipulation of auction bids outcomes for legitimate bidders as malicious bidders monitor the mempool, front run legitimate bids and manipulate the auction state to their advantages.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L250
the bid() and removeExcessBids() function lacks of protection against front running and reliance on public transaction ordering allows attacker to exploit the auction mechanism.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Victim submits a bid
- A legitimate user submits a bid transaction with the specific parameters `buyReserveAmount` , `sellCouponAmount`
- the transaction get broadcasted to the mempool but not yet included in a block
2 Attacker monitors the mempool
- The attacker monitors the mempol for pending bid transaction and the attacker analyzes the victim transaction to determine the bid parameters
3 Attacker submits a competing Bid
The attacker submits their own bid transaction with slightly better terms ( higher `buyReserveAmount or lower `sellCouponAmount`)
4. Attacker bid is processed first
the attacker bid is included in a block first, altering the auction state (updating `currentCouponAmount`, `lowestBidIndex`
5 Victims Bid is processed
- The victim bid is processed after the attackers bid
- Due to the altered state, the victimBid may be removed by `removeExcessBids` or fail to meet the update auction conditions.

Example scenario:
Auction Details:
Total Capacity: totalBuyCouponAmount = 1000 tokens.

Current State: currentCouponAmount = 900 tokens.

Lowest Bid: A bid with sellCouponAmount = 100 tokens is currently the lowest bid.

Victim's Action:
The victim submits a bid with:

buyReserveAmount = 200 tokens.

sellCouponAmount = 100 tokens.

Attacker's Action:
The attacker monitors the mempool and detects the victim's bid.

The attacker submits a competing bid with:

buyReserveAmount = 201 tokens (slightly higher to ensure priority).

sellCouponAmount = 100 tokens.

A higher gas fee to ensure their transaction is mined first.

Outcome:
Attacker's Bid is Processed First:

The attacker's bid is included in the auction, updating currentCouponAmount to 1000 tokens.

The attacker's bid becomes the new lowest bid.

Victim's Bid is Processed:

The victim's bid is processed next, but currentCouponAmount would exceed totalBuyCouponAmount (1000 + 100 = 1100).

The removeExcessBids function is triggered, and the victim's bid is removed.

### Impact

Although there is no direct loss of funds but it has other impact on the user bid removed

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a Commit-Reveal Scheme:

Require bidders to submit a commitment (e.g., a hash of their bid parameters) in the first transaction.

In a second transaction, bidders reveal their actual bid parameters, which are verified against the commitment.

This prevents attackers from knowing the bid details in advance and front-running.
