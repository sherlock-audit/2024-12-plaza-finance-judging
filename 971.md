# The fee calculation which the protocol claims is incorrect and this could unfair to users

## Summary

The protocol claims fees from reserve tokens in the pool, with the fee amount calculated based on the time elapsed from `lastFeeClaimTime` to the current time. However, this calculation is incorrect, leading to unfairness for users.

## Root Cause

In the [claimFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L700-L712) function of `Pool.sol`, the protocol claims a fee, which is a proportion of the reserve token.

```solidity
  function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
    require(msg.sender == feeBeneficiary || poolFactory.hasRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE(), msg.sender), NotBeneficiary());
@>  uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();
    
    if (feeAmount == 0) {
      revert NoFeesToClaim();
    }
    
    lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
    
    emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
  }
```

The fee amount is calculated based on the elapsed time from `lastFeeClaimTime` to the current time, rather than from the time of the deposit of reserve tokens. 

As a result, the protocol ends up claiming more fees than it should, which is particularly unfair to users who deposited just before the fee claim.

```solidity
  function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }
```

## Internal Pre-Conditions


## External Pre-Conditions


## Attack Path


## Impact

The protocol claims more fees than the correct value, resulting in unfair treatment of users.

## Mitigation

Revise the fee calculation to be based on the time elapsed from the deposit time of the reserve tokens to the current time, ensuring a fairer distribution of fees.
