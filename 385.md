# Lack of Precision in redeemRate Calculation

### Summary

The use of multiplication by ```PRECISION``` after division in the redeem rate calculation will cause inaccurate redeem amounts for users as the protocol will provide incorrect values when users attempt to redeem their tokens. 
This lack of precision during integer division can lead to financial discrepancies and undermine user trust in the protocol.


### Root Cause

The choice to multiply by ```PRECISION``` after performing the division in the [Pool.sol:514](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L514) is a mistake as it leads to precision loss during integer division. 

This occurs because the calculation:
```solidity
redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

n/a

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User calls the redeem function to convert their tokens back into underlying assets.
2. During the execution of the redeem function, the protocol calculates the redeem rate using the getRedeemAmount function.
3. The calculation in getRedeemAmount involves a division operation that leads to precision loss because multiplication by PRECISION occurs after the division.
4. As a result, the redeem rate is inaccurately calculated, which may lead to the user receiving less value than expected when redeeming their tokens.
5. The user experiences a financial discrepancy, potentially resulting in a loss of trust in the protocol's reliability and fairness.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Should update code like below.

```solidity
redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION / assetSupply);
```
