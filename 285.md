# Overflow and Truncation When Typecasting int56 to int24 Without Validation

### Summary

In the  function latestRoundData() of BondOracleAdapter contract, an attempt to typecast an int56 value to int24 without validating it would lead to overflow and truncation errors. When the downcast is performed on a  large value, it would cause incorrect result of getSqrtTwapX96  and Loss of fund due to invalid price return when the values exceed the bounds of the int24 type.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/BondOracleAdapter.sol#L110
```solidity
  function latestRoundData()
    external
    view
    returns (uint80, int256, uint256, uint256, uint80){
    uint32[] memory secondsAgos = new uint32[](2);
    secondsAgos[0] = twapInterval; // from (before)
    secondsAgos[1] = 0; // to (now)

    (int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = ICLPool(dexPool).observe(secondsAgos);

    uint160 getSqrtTwapX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(
>>>      int24((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int56(uint56(twapInterval)))
    );

    return (uint80(0), int256(getPriceX96FromSqrtPriceX96(getSqrtTwapX96)), block.timestamp, block.timestamp, uint80(0));
  }
```
The root cause of the issue lies in the line of the code above where the calculation of getSqrtTwapX96 downcast int56 value to int24 without first confirming it is below int24. 
Here, the difference between two int56 values (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) is divided by a value of type int56. The result of this division is then cast to int24, which is a smaller integer type.

int24 can only hold values between -8,388,608 and 8,388,607. when the result of the division exceeds this range, the value will be truncated and would return a different value than expected.


### External Pre-conditions

When The tickCumulatives[1] and tickCumulatives[0] values may represent large numbers depending on the price changes within the pool, which could easily exceed the limits of the int24 type and stay above it regardless of division by twapInterval

### Attack Path

An attacker could manipulate the inputs (e.g., by interacting with the decentralized exchange pool or influencing the twapInterval value) to produce results that are out of range for the int24 type. Since these values are not validated before the typecasting operation, this would cause overflow and value truncation.


### Impact

Incorrect Calculations: This Overflow and truncation would lead to incorrect results being returned by the latestRoundData() function. This would impact price feeds, resulting in inaccurate data being used for subsequent calculations or decision-making.
Loss of Funds: when inaccurate price information is fed into other functions that rely on it for financial calculations or trade decisions, users would suffer financial losses.

### PoC

To simulate the issue,  a scenario where tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0] results in a value greater than 8,388,607 i.e int24 max , or where the result of the division has significant digits beyond the capacity of int24 even after division by twapInterval

int56 tickCumulatives[2] = [int56(10000000000), int56(999999999)];
uint56 twapInterval = 10;
int24 result = int24((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int56(twapInterval)); // Results in overflow or truncation
In this case, the value 10000000000 - 999999999 = 9000000001 is divided by 10, yielding 900000000. Casting 900000000 to int24 truncates it to -5969664, which is a completely different result and would break protocol functionality.
This can be tested on remix using this test function :
```solidity
function TestDowncasting(int56 test) external pure returns (int24) {
            return int24(test);
    }
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate the overflow and truncation issues, the following validation strategies should be implemented before performing the typecast to ensure the value is not above int24 before type conversion:
The addition to the latestRoundData() function should look similar to provided code below before ussage
```solidity
int56 difference = tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0];
int56 value = difference / int56(twapInterval);

require(value >= int24(type(int24).min) && value <= int24(type(int24).max), "Value out of range for int24");
int24 result = int24(value);
```
