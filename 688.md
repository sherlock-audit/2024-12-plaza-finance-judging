# Shares are added even with failed auctions

### Summary

Auction can be failed in  `State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD` or `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` conditions. But [share](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L194C18-L194C50)  added to user even with failed auctions. It should be prevent adding share value with failed auctions.   

### Root Cause

User `indexedAmountShares`  value is updated on each and every `currentPeriod`. It don't consider either auction is failed or not. 

```solidity

function updateIndexedUserAssets(address user, uint256 balance) internal {
    uint256 period = globalPool.currentPeriod;
    uint256 shares = getIndexedUserAmount(user, balance, period);
    
    userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares = shares;
    userAssets[user].lastUpdatedPeriod = period;

    emit UpdatedUserAssets(user, period, shares);
  }
```

```solidity
function getIndexedUserAmount(address user, uint256 balance, uint256 period) public view returns(uint256) {
    IndexedUserAssets memory userPool = userAssets[user];
    uint256 shares = userPool.indexedAmountShares;

    for (uint256 i = userPool.lastUpdatedPeriod; i < period; i++) {
      shares += (balance * globalPool.previousPoolAmounts[i].sharesPerToken).toBaseUnit(SHARES_DECIMALS);
    }

    return shares;
  }
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

Auction need to failed in `State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD` or `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` conditions.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Start [auction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L530C12-L530C24).
2. Auction is ended in either `State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD` or `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` conditions.
3. User shares value is added including this failed auction period as well later on user [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Distributor.sol#L78C12-L78C17) his shares.

### Impact

Protocol needs to pay more couponToken including failed auctions as well for Bond token Holders. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Its need to check either auction is ended in `State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD` or `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` conditions then it needs to prevent updating  `userAssets[user].indexedAmountShares` in `updateIndexedUserAssets` function on those failed conditions.
