# [0xgh0st] - User exposed to lose his funds due to lack of slippage protection.

### Summary

As we know the Chainlink oracle, used as a price feed is exposed to collapse and we have witnessed that in [several occasion](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/), where price drop significantly.
We notice that `getOraclePrice` doesn't implement any verification between that `lastPrice` and the new one.

This function is used in both function of pool contract `redeem()` and `create()`.
### Root Cause
Lack of verification against slippage.

### Attack Path

1. The Chainlink oracle collapse which will return dropped price.
2. User try to redeem his funds, which make him suffer from a significant loss.

### Impact

Users can lose all their funds.

### Mitigation

```solidity
	function _isPriceChangeAboveMaxDeviation(
		uint256 _maxDeviationBetweenRounds,
		uint256 _currResponse,
		uint256 _prevResponse
	) internal pure returns (bool) {

		uint256 minPrice = min(_prevResponse, _currResponse);
		uint256 maxPrice = max(_currResponse, _prevResponse);

		/*
		 * Use the larger price as the denominator:
		 * - If price decreased, the percentage deviation is in relation to the previous price.
		 * - If price increased, the percentage deviation is in relation to the current price.
		 */
		uint256 percentDeviation = ((maxPrice - minPrice) * DECIMAL_PRECISION) / maxPrice;

		return percentDeviation > _maxDeviationBetweenRounds;
	}
```
