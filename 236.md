# Some price feeds for tokens used in the protocol do not exist.

## Bug description
Protocol's reserve token is expected to be either of WETH, wstETH, WBTC, cbBTC, rETH or BPT (Balancer Pool token).

When depositing or redeeming from the Pool, the price of the reserve token in USD is queried from the oracle.

[Pool.sol#L284-L293](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L284-L293)
```solidity
getCreateAmount(
    tokenType,
    depositAmount,
    bondSupply,
    levSupply,
    poolReserves,
    getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD),
    getOracleDecimals(reserveToken, USD)
).normalizeAmount(COMMON_DECIMALS, assetDecimals);
```

`getOraclePrice()` will try to get the reserveToken/USD or USD/reserveToken price feed.

[OracleReader.sol#L57-L63](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L57-L63)
```solidity
address feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(quote, base);
if (feed == address(0)) {
    feed = OracleFeeds(oracleFeeds).priceFeeds(base, quote);
    if (feed == address(0)) {
        revert NoFeedFound();
    }
    // Invert the price
    isInverted = true;
}
```

However, if we look at the chainlink [price feeds](https://data.chain.link/feeds) available on the Base network, we will see that there are no USD oracles for wstETH and rETH. The only oracles available are wstETH/ETH and rETH/ETH data feeds. This makes it impossible to query USD price of those assets.

## Root cause
Price feeds do not exist for some of the tokens that are expected to be used in the protocol.

## Attack path
No attack path.

## Impact
No way to get the USD price of wstETH and rETH.

## Recommended Mitigation
For assets that do not have USD oracles, query their price in terms of ETH and convert that amount to USD using ETH/USD oracle.
