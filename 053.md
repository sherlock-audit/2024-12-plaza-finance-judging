# TWAP price manipulation

### Summary

The `observe()` call in BalancerOracleAdapter.sol:107 is vulnerable to TWAP price manipulation. Due to:
-  The pools obseravation cardinality not being checked 
-  Whether the requested time window `secondAgo` is available

If the pool cardinality is 1, it'll only store the most recent observation and will fall back to using current price instead of historical data making TWAP meaningless as it's just current price. This makes the price easier to manipulate

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This vulnerability can lead to inaccurate price calculations, potentially resulting in loss of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Revert if oldestObservation < `secondsAgo` to ensure the full intended TWAP period is used.
- Check the cardinality of the pool and set it to a reasonable number, so a number of observations would be used to calculate the TWAP
