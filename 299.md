# Attacker Can Force Auction into State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD

### Summary

The `Auction` contract facilitates a mechanism where users interested in purchasing the `underlying` assets (commonly Balancer LPs) can bid using `buyCouponToken` (likely USDC) within a specific time frame. After this period, any user can call `endAuction` to finalize the auction and begin distributing the LP tokens.

The issue arises because an attacker can manipulate the auction to end in the `State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD`, undermining its purpose.

### Root Cause

The contract maintains a record of the top `maxBids` (e.g., 1000) ranked by their profitability in terms of the `couponToken/underlying` ratio. Bids outside of this range are deleted and refunded.
An attacker can exploit this by submitting a slightly more profitable bid (higher couponAmount/underlying ratio) than the current lowestBid at the last moment of the auction. This causes the contract to remove and refund the `lowestBid`, reducing the `currentCouponAmount`. If this happens right before the auction ends, it can lead to a condition where `currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount`, forcing the auction into `State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* Maximum bids (maxBids) have been reached, and the totalBuyCouponAmount has been met.

* The auction is close to its end time.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker submits a bid with a better couponAmount/underlying ratio than the lowestBid but with a smaller couponAmount.

2. The contract removes the current lowestBid and refunds its value.

3. This reduces the currentCouponAmount below the totalBuyCouponAmount threshold before the auction ends.

### Impact

The auction ends in the `State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD`, preventing the protocol from achieving its intended purpose.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Once the maximum number of bids (maxBids) has been reached, prohibit any new bids with a couponAmount lower than the couponAmount of the bid that will be refunded.
