# `Pool` lacks mechanism to access residual couponTokens

## Summary

Excess coupon tokens can be stuck in `Pool` since contract lacks mechanism to retrieve them

## Vulnerability Details

In the event where there are excess coupon tokens stuck in the Pool contract, the contract lacks a mechanism for an authorized role to utilize residual couponTokens.

If Pool receives residual couponTokens via

- Accidentally received by Pool contract
- Excess couponTokens given to Auction contract that are not part of bids and transferred when a successful auction ends
- Pool distribution fails and coupon tokens remain in contract

## Impact

Coupon tokens are inaccessible and locked in Pool contract.

## Mitigation

Consider modifying Pool.distribute to also make use of residual coupon tokens and distribute them to bondETH holders. Protocol can also consider implementing a seperate function that only authorized roles can call to retrieve residual coupon tokens
