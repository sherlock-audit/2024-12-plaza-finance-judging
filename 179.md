# Auction bidding will be bricked for everyone by blacklisted user

### Summary

Users bid USDC in the auction process. If a user gets blacklisted by USDC after bidding, and they’re the lowest bidder, they cannot be removed from the auction. And if they cannot be removed, Auction::bid function will fail in all subsequent calls. No one can bid from that point onward. This could cause multiple problems and bring about different vulnerability scenarios which I’ll outline in the details section.

But before, let’s remember that according to Sherlock rules this issue is valid. Sherlock docs mention blacklisting related issues on clauses 6 and 9:

> 
> 
> 1. **User Blacklist:** User getting blacklisted by a token/contract causing harm only to themselves is **not** a valid medium/high.

> 
> 
> 1. **Contract / Admin Address Blacklisting / Freezing:**
> 
> If a protocol's smart contracts or admin addresses get added to a "blacklist" and the functionality of the protocol is affected by this blacklist, this is not considered a valid issue.
> **However, there could be cases where an attacker would use a blacklisted address to cause harm to a protocol functioning.**

This issue bricks the auction bidding system, it does hurt the whole auction process, and it very similar to the valid example bug given by Sherlock docs. Thus, this issue is also valid as it does not only contend itself with the blacklisted user, but hurts everyone after that blacklisted user by blocking the auction bidding system.

### Root Cause

In auctions, users bid USDC. When the bidCount exceeds maxBids, the lowest bidder is kicked out of the queue.

```solidity
        if (bidCount > maxBids) {
            if (lowestBidIndex == newBidIndex) {
                revert BidAmountTooLow();
            }
            _removeBid(lowestBidIndex);
        }
```

and _removeBid function attempts to refund the to-be-kicked-out lowest bidder.

```solidity
    // Refund the buy tokens for the removed bid
        //@audit blacklisted user won't be able to be deleted as this will revert
        IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);
```

But, if a user has entered the auction, and after they entered, they got blacklisted by USDC, this line will not work. They won’t be able to receive their funds back, so the function will revert.

Since they are the lowest bidder, and this line is called via the bid function, each time when another user wants to bid, this line, thus the bid function will always revert. No one can bid after the blacklisted user. 

It is known that there are actions that cause an address to get blacklisted, so a user can either knowingly or unwittingly get themselves blacklisted. In either case, the auction for that period will be bricked. 

The attacker can use this vulnerability for their own gain too. When a new auction starts, they can bid with 2 separate addresses, one with a very small amount to make sure that it’s the lowest bidder, and one that’s asking for higher shares (with small amounts or not, depends on the attacker’s whim). Then, they proceed to get the lowest bidding address blacklisted, and thus they become and REMAIN as the highest, or at least quite a high bidder. Since no one else can bid afterwards, they can claim all, or majority of the shares with small amounts with their main, non-blacklisted address. 

### Case 2

If bidCount is less than maxBids, then removeExcessBids function will be called. There, again, if the lowest bidder has been blacklisted after bidding, in the case amountToRemove >= sellCouponAmount,  _removeBid function is called again, which I showed that it will revert and block further biddings.

In the else clause, if amountToRemove < sellCouponAmount, the excess amount is skimmed from the lowest bidder. There we also have a transfer of USDC, which will revert.

```solidity
             // Refund the proportional sellAmount
                //@audit whole loop will revert if one of the bidders get blacklisted
                IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(
                    currentBid.bidder,
                    amountToRemove
                );
```

Thus, in all cases with the auction bid functionality, if a lowest bidder gets blacklisted after bidding, the whole auction bidding system will be bricked.

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Auction for that period is bricked, no one else can bid after the attacker (or unwitting user) gets blacklisted. If this vulnerability is taken advantage of, the attacker can get all the shares or at least the majority of them without competitors.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider trying to transfer and skipping if there is any malfunction, or, do not send the funds to the kicked out bidders directly, but increase their claim funds, so that they can claim it themselves via a totally different function that is unrelated to the bid function, so that bid cannot be blocked this way.
