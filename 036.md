# Unbounded Gas Consumption in `removeExcessBids()` Leading to Potential Denial of Service


### **Summary and Impact**

The `removeExcessBids()` function within the `Auction.sol` smart contract contains an unbounded `while` loop that iterates through bids to eliminate any excess bids exceeding the `totalBuyCouponAmount`. This design flaw can result in excessive gas consumption, potentially surpassing the Ethereum block gas limit when handling a large number of small bids. Consequently, transactions invoking this function—such as placing new bids or concluding auctions—may consistently revert, effectively freezing the auction mechanism. This denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability disrupts the normal operation of the auction system, preventing the removal of excess bids and undermining the protocol's ability to maintain its invariants related to bid management and auction success criteria.

---

### **Vulnerability Details**

The vulnerability arises from the `removeExcessBids()` function's implementation, which employs an unbounded `while` loop to iterate through bids for removal. In scenarios where numerous small bids accumulate, the loop's iterations can escalate to a point where the gas required exceeds the block gas limit, causing the function—and consequently, any function that calls it—to revert. This renders the auction process inoperative, as excess bids cannot be trimmed, leading to stalled or manipulated auctions.

#### **Test Code Snippet**

```solidity
function testRemoveExcessBidsHighLoop() public {
    // 4. We simulate a scenario with many micro-bids.
    // We'll keep placing bids until we exceed totalBuyCouponAmount.

    // Fund bidder
    buyCouponToken.mint(bidder1, 1000000 ether);
    vm.startPrank(bidder1);
    buyCouponToken.approve(address(auction), 1000000 ether);

    // Make each bid with a minimal sellCouponAmount to amplify # of bids
    // e.g. 1 token each. We keep going until we overshoot totalBuyCouponAmount
    // so that removeExcessBids() triggers. 
    uint256 totalBids = 1500; 
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalBids; i++) {
        // This line triggers removeExcessBids, which grows in cost with each iteration
        auction.bid(1 ether, 1); 
    }

    vm.stopPrank();

    // 5. If removeExcessBids is unbounded, we anticipate a revert or extremely high gas usage 
    // when new bids attempt to remove many small bids. 
    // We check if the Auction can still proceed or if it reverts.
    
    // You can measure gas usage or check revert with e.g.
    vm.startPrank(bidder2);
    buyCouponToken.mint(bidder2, 10000 ether);
    buyCouponToken.approve(address(auction), 10000 ether);
    
    // This final big bid might push removeExcessBids over the gas limit in real scenario
    // For demonstration, we only show that the call doesn't revert under "normal" conditions
    // but if the loop were truly unbounded, it’d revert on a large scale test with a real block gas limit.
    
    auction.bid(100 ether, 5000);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Accumulation of Small Bids**: The test simulates an auction environment where a single bidder (`bidder1`) places a large number of minimal bids (`1 ether` with `1` sell coupon amount), exceeding the `totalBuyCouponAmount`. This triggers the `removeExcessBids()` function to process and remove the excess bids.

2. **Unbounded Loop Execution**: As `removeExcessBids()` iterates through each small bid, the gas consumed per iteration accumulates. With `1500` such bids, the cumulative gas usage can surpass the block gas limit.

3. **Potential Reversion**: When the gas required for the loop exceeds the block gas limit, the transaction reverts, causing the auction to become non-functional. Subsequent attempts to place new bids or conclude the auction will fail, effectively causing a denial of service.

### **Recommendations**

**Iteration Cap**:
   - **Implementation**: Introduce a counter within the `while` loop to limit the number of iterations per transaction. If the counter exceeds a predefined safe limit, the function should exit gracefully or allow for partial processing in subsequent transactions.
   - **Benefit**: Prevents the loop from running indefinitely and ensures that gas consumption remains within manageable bounds.
