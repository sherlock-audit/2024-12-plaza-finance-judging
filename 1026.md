# Incorrect ordering of quote and base token parameters in getOraclePrice in the return statement of simulateCreate will cause incorrect price calculations

### Summary

Incorrect ordering of quote and base token parameters in `getOraclePrice` in the return statement of `simulateCreate` 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L284-L292
 causes the function to return inverted price ratios, leading to wrongly valued TVL calculations and wrong token creation amounts for users.

The way the parameters are passed to getOraclePrice means reserveToken is quote and USD is base. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/OracleReader.sol#L50-L76

But the parameter that getCreateAmount actually wants is the ethPrice (i.e., reserveToken as base and USD as quote)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L295-L316

(Some reference material on base and quote pairs: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/foreign-currency-pairs.asp

> A typical currency pair listing may be EUR/USD 1.3045. The euro (EUR) is the base currency, and the U.S. dollar (USD) is the quote currency. Here, €1 equals $1.3045.)

### Root Cause

In Pool.sol:simulateCreate(), the getOraclePrice() function is called with (reserveToken, USD) when it should be (USD, reserveToken). Per the function's documentation and design, the first parameter should be the quote currency and the second parameter should be the base currency. This reversal causes the function to return how many ETH it takes to buy 1 USD instead of how many USD it takes to buy 1 ETH.

The way the parameters are passed to getOraclePrice means reserveToken is quote and USD is base.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. bondToken.totalSupply() must be greater than 0
2. Pool contract must be initialized with valid token addresses and parameters
3. Valid Chainlink oracle feeds must be configured in OracleFeeds contract

### External Pre-conditions

Chainlink price feed must be returning valid price data for ETH/USD pair

### Attack Path

1. User calls `Pool.create()` to mint tokens
2. `Pool.create()` calls simulateCreate() for amount calculation
3. `simulateCreate()` calls getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD) with incorrect quote/base order
4. `getOraclePrice()` returns inverted price ratio (0.5 USD/ETH instead of 2000 USD/ETH)
5. `getCreateAmount()` calculates TVL using inverted price
6. Lower TVL triggers different collateral level calculation path
7. User receives fewer tokens than protocol design intends

### Impact

Users receive significantly reduced token amounts due to the incorrect price ratio being used in calculations. When depositing ETH, the inverted price ratio leads to severely undervalued TVL calculations which affect the token creation formula.

Using our proof of concept with a 1 ETH deposit at $2000 USD/ETH price, users receive 12.5 tokens instead of the intended 20 tokens. This represents a 37.5% reduction in minted tokens compared to the protocol's design, far exceeding Sherlock's 1% threshold. This vulnerability qualifies as a High severity issue according to Sherlock's criteria as it causes a direct and significant loss of funds without extensive external conditions or constraints. Given that ETH's value is typically in the thousands of dollars, the $10 minimum threshold is also easily surpassed.

### PoC

### GIVEN VALUES:

depositAmount = 1 ETH = 1e18
bondSupply = 100 tokens = 100e18
levSupply = 50 tokens = 50e18
poolReserves = 10 ETH = 10e18
BOND_TARGET_PRICE = 100
PRECISION = 1_000_000 (1e6)
COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD = 1_200_000 (1.2 with PRECISION)
tokenType = TokenType.BOND

### For price feeds:
ETH/USD feed exists with value 2000 USD/ETH (200000000000 with 8 decimals)

### **SCENARIO 1: Current code - getOraclePrice(reserveToken, USD)**

Step 1: Oracle Price Calculation
- Tries reserveToken/USD feed (not found)
- Uses USD/reserveToken feed (ETH/USD = 2000)
- isInverted = true
- decimals = 8
- Price = (10^8 * 10^8) / 200000000000 = 50000000 (0.5 USD/ETH with 8 decimals)

Step 2: TVL Calculation
tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals)
tvl = (50000000 * 10e18) / 10^8
tvl = 5e18 USD

Step 3: Collateral Level
collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)
collateralLevel = (5e18 * 1_000_000) / (100e18 * 100)
collateralLevel = 500_000 (0.5 with PRECISION)

Step 4: Creation Rate (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD)
creationRate = (tvl * POINT_EIGHT) / bondSupply
creationRate = (5e18 * 800_000) / 100e18
creationRate = 40_000

Step 5: Final Amount
amount = ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals)
amount = ((1e18 * 50000000 * 1_000_000) / 40_000) / 10^8
amount = 12.5e18 tokens


### **SCENARIO 2: Proposed fix - getOraclePrice(USD, reserveToken)**


Step 1: Oracle Price Calculation
- Tries USD/reserveToken feed (not found)
- Uses reserveToken/USD feed (ETH/USD = 2000)
- isInverted = false
- Price = 200000000000 (2000 USD/ETH with 8 decimals)

Step 2: TVL Calculation
tvl = (ethPrice * poolReserves).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals)
tvl = (200000000000 * 10e18) / 10^8
tvl = 20000e18 USD

Step 3: Collateral Level
collateralLevel = (tvl * PRECISION) / (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)
collateralLevel = (20000e18 * 1_000_000) / (100e18 * 100)
collateralLevel = 2_000_000 (2.0 with PRECISION)

Step 4: Creation Rate (collateralLevel > COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD)
creationRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION
creationRate = 100 * 1_000_000
creationRate = 100_000_000

Step 5: Final Amount
amount = ((depositAmount * ethPrice * PRECISION) / creationRate).toBaseUnit(oracleDecimals)
amount = ((1e18 * 200000000000 * 1_000_000) / 100_000_000) / 10^8
amount = 20e18 tokens



### Mitigation

Correct the quote/base parameter order
