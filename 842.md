# Fee is charged current reserveToken pool balance to time which is not updated

### Summary

[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L700C1-L720C4) fee is charged from `lastFeeClaimTime` to current time but with current `reserveToken` token pool balance. But fee should be charged on every reserveToken balance is changed. That can be accomplished via `claimFees` function is invoked every user `create` and `redeem` activities. 

### Root Cause

Fee is charged based on current `reserveToken` balance where `feeBeneficiary` is invoked  `claimFees` function. But time to time `reserveToken` can be changed. So fee should be calculated each and every time when `reserveToken` balance is changed. 

```solidity
  function claimFees() public nonReentrant {
    require(msg.sender == feeBeneficiary || poolFactory.hasRole(poolFactory.GOV_ROLE(), msg.sender), NotBeneficiary());
    uint256 feeAmount = getFeeAmount();
    
    if (feeAmount == 0) {
      revert NoFeesToClaim();
    }
    
    lastFeeClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
    
    emit FeeClaimed(feeBeneficiary, feeAmount);
  }

  /**
   * @dev Returns the amount of fees to be claimed.
   * @return The amount of fees to be claimed.
   */
  function getFeeAmount() internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (IERC20(reserveToken).balanceOf(address(this)) * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Can happen in normal operation.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Consider this scenario , pool is consist of 10e18 reserveToken throughout the year at the year end , some one is deposited 1000e18 reserveToken , now `feeBeneficiary` is called `claimFees` , here fee is overcharged. meaning fee is calculated as 1000e18 token is in pool throughout the year. 
2. pool is consist of 1000e18 reserveToken through out  the year at the year end , most of users are redeem , due to that reserveToken balance is 10e18  , now `feeBeneficiary` is called `claimFees` , here fee is undercharged. meaning fee is calculated as 10e18 token is in pool throughout the year.  

### Impact

1. Fee is not collected correctly so that it could be overcharged or undercharged . 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`claimFees` can be invoked inside of  [_create](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L222C12-L222C19) and [_redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L383C12-L383C19) functions.
