# Chainlink Heartbeat Discrepancies

### Summary

The heatbeat set in `OracleFeeds::setPriceFeed` is too long. The price of an asset is hardcoded to a day, during this period, the actual market price could fluctuate, making the on-chain price different from the true price

### Root Cause

The heatbeat set in `OracleFeeds::setPriceFeed` is too long. The heartbeat duration in the price feed configuration is set too conservatively, allowing price data to remain unchanged for extended periods without forcing an update. This fundamental configuration issue means the system could operate with outdated price information even when the oracle is functioning correctly.

### Mitigation

1. Use Multiple Price Feeds: Aggregating data from multiple independent oracles can help ensure that the price of an asset is updated more frequently and accurately, reducing the likelihood of exploitable discrepancies. Although this increases gas costs and system complexity, it provides a more robust defense against price manipulation.

2. Dynamic Update Intervals: Instead of fixed heartbeats, consider using dynamic update intervals that trigger based on real-time market conditions. This approach ensures that price updates happen more frequently during periods of volatility, reducing the window for potential arbitrage.

3. Price Discrepancy Monitoring: Implement on-chain logic that monitors the price difference between oracle data and real-world market prices. If the discrepancy exceeds a certain threshold, the protocol can pause transactions involving the affected asset, preventing arbitrage until prices are realigned.

4. Time-Limited Price Validity: Set time limits on the validity of price feeds. If a price has not been updated within a specific timeframe, the contract could prevent further interactions with the affected asset until an updated price is retrieved.
