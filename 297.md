# USDC Blocklist Feature Can DOS Auction By Breaking Remove/Refund Logic

### Summary

Due to USDC's ability to blocklist addresses, if a bidder gets blocklisted during an auction, their bid becomes "stuck" as the refund mechanism will fail. This prevents other bids from removing lower bids and can effectively DOS the auction's normal operation.

### Root Cause

In Auction.sol - [_removeBid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L325): when a bid needs to be removed or refunded, `buyCouponToken` (USDC) is transferred back to the bidder.

```solidity
function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
    Bid storage bidToRemove = bids[bidIndex];
    
    // ... linked list updates ...
  
    // Refund USDC to bidder - Will fail if bidder is blocklisted
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);

    emit BidRemoved(bidIndex, bidder, buyReserveAmount, sellCouponAmount);
    delete bids[bidIndex];
    bidCount--;
}
```
However, this will fail if bidder suddenly becomes blocklisted in USDC.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker places multiple bids in auction 
    - buyReserveAmount: 10000000 wstETH
    - sellCouponAmount: 100 USDC (assuming this is the mininum slotSize)
2. Gets their address blocklisted in USDC
3. Higher bids try to remove attacker's bids
4. `safeTransfer` fails due to blocklist
5. Removal transaction reverts
6. Attacker's bids remain stuck in queue
7. After Auction Ends successfully, attacker can claim a large amount of reserves and only paid minimum USDC amount.


### Impact

When a bidder becomes `blocklisted`, their bids cannot be removed from the auction queue. This prevents higher bids from entering and can effectively freeze the auction's normal operation, as any attempt to remove or refund these bids will fail. Also, beyond just breaking auction functionality, this vulnerability allows an attacker to secure large amounts of reserve tokens (e.g. wstETH) with minimal USDC investment by exploiting the blocklist feature to prevent their low-price bids from being removed.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Instead of direct transfers during bid removal, implement a claim Refund for bids that were removed.
