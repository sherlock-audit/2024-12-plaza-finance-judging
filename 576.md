# There is inconsistency in fee taken on reserve in pool contract

### Summary

When user create or redeem reserve tokens, there will be fees deducted by protocol in the calculation of the amount user will get. This fees are calculated on the pool reserves at the time of create or redeem by the user. That means this reserves will be always different at every create or redeem.
In `simulateCreate` function:
```solidity
    // Calculate and subtract fees from poolReserves
    poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
```

In `simulateRedeem` function:
```solidity
    // Calculate and subtract fees from poolReserves
    poolReserves = poolReserves - (poolReserves * fee * (block.timestamp - lastFeeClaimTime)) / (PRECISION * SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
```
Now the actual fee is charged when fee collector claims fees with `claimFees` function or gov_role will set new fee rate with `setFee` function because in that `claimFees` is called.

So the problem is that user will get amount based on the fees deducted pool reserve at that time while create or redeem and when fee collector claims fees there will be different pool reserves so that fee collector can get low fees than he should get if at the time of the claim, reserves of the pool will be low and vice a versa if at the time of claim, fee collector will get high fees than actual if pool reserves will be more.

Also the problem is that, this fees are for the whole duration from last claimed timestamp that means before claiming fees if there will be significant change in the fees then that will affect the fees for the whole duration from the last claim to the current timestamp.

So suppose last claimed timestamp is t=1 and fee collector claims at timestamp t=10, now if at t=9 or before, a major redeem of the reserve token and reserve token decrease the fees will be on that decreased reserve token for whole duration for t=1 to t=10 which will be major loss in fees for the fee collector. This will apply vice versa if reserve token increases.

That means there is very much inconsistency in the fees which can be loss for the fee collector or user if charged high cause ultimately reserves decreases which is loss for users.

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

There can be different possibilities about fees like fee collector will get significantly low fees or significantly high fees due to various scenarios mentioned in the summary section.

### Impact

The impact of this inconsistency will affect either fee collector with getting low fees or the user with less reserve token due to high fees to the fee collector. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Protocol should revise fee calculation and make sure that fees are charge for the actual reserve token for specific time period rather than reserve at particular time and for the whole period from last claimed timestamp.
