# Auction state will be wrongly assumed as unsuccessful while thats not the case

### Summary

When an ongoing auction must end users would call `Auction::endAuction()` which will perform multiple checks and return the final state of it which will determine if the auction is successful or not. One of the checks being performed is to make sure that `totalSellReserveAmount >= poolSaleLimit` . The issue is that the case `totalSellReserveAmount == poolSaleLimit` is assumed as not satisfied and the auction will be wrongly set as `failed` while this shouldn't be true because `totalSellReserveAmount` is not exceeding the `poolSaleLimit`. 

### Root Cause

When an action is being created one of the params being initialized with is `poolSaleLimit`.  The `poolSaleLimit` is in control of the `GOV_ROLE` and the minimum value to which can be set is 90% of the pool reserve balance. When `endAuction()` function is called and `totalSellReserveAmount` is being checked if its exceeding the `poolLimitBalance` or not the auction must be assumed as successful in case when `totalSellReserveAmount == poolSaleLimit`, but thats not the case. For example if  `totalSellReserveAmount ` is asking for 95% of the pool reserve balance while `poolLimitBalance` is set to 95% , the state of the auction will be set to `Failed` while it should pass because the pool limit is not exceeded.

```solidity
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();


    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
@>    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
          state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }


    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

At the end of the auction `totalSellReserveAmount == poolSaleLimit`

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

When `endAuction()` is called and `totalSellReserveAmount == poolSaleLimit` it will wrongly set the state of the auction to `Failed` instead of being set to  `successful`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
  function endAuction() external auctionExpired whenNotPaused {
    if (state != State.BIDDING) revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();


    if (currentCouponAmount < totalBuyCouponAmount) {
      state = State.FAILED_UNDERSOLD;
    }
-        else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) 
+       else if (totalSellReserveAmount > (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
    } else {
      state = State.SUCCEEDED;
      Pool(pool).transferReserveToAuction(totalSellReserveAmount);
      IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(beneficiary, IERC20(buyCouponToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }


    emit AuctionEnded(state, totalSellReserveAmount, totalBuyCouponAmount);
