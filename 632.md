# Users Can Claim Shares From Current Unfinished Period Due to Period Synchronization Issue

### Summary

Due to incorrect period synchronization and lack of period validation in Distributor's claim function, users can claim shares from the current ongoing period before they should be claimable, leading to system disruption as these shares have not been allocated yet from the pool.

### Root Cause

In Distributor.sol's claim function, it uses the currentPeriod from bondToken which is offset by 1 due to the startAuction() period increment issue:

```solidity
function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    // Gets currentPeriod which is N+1 due to startAuction() incrementing period
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    
    // Calculates shares using the wrong period
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, currentPeriod);
    
    // Deducts from couponAmountToDistribute which hasn't been allocated for period N+1
    couponAmountToDistribute -= shares;
    bondToken.resetIndexedUserAssets(msg.sender);
    IERC20(couponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, shares);
}
```

The issue arises because:

startAuction() increments period from N to N+1
claim() uses period N+1 to calculate shares
But allocate() hasn't been called for period N+1 yet
This allows claiming shares that haven't been allocated

Making the user to claim shares that may correspond to previous users who haven't claimed yet
this will break the `couponAmountToDistribute` state variable tracking, since this user shares wasn't added with the `allocate` function
making future users claim to revert

This issue was not caught during testing because the test suites of `Distributor.t.sol` deploys the Auction contract independently rather than using Pool.startAuction(). This means the tests don't properly simulate the period management that occurs in production, where startAuction() increments the period and creates this synchronization issue.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users can claim shares from the current period N+1 before:

- The auction for period N completes
- The pool distributes and allocates tokens for period N

This disrupts the protocol's distribution mechanism and can lead to:

- Users claiming unearned shares
- System accounting mismatches
- Future allocate() calls reverting due to insufficient balance

### Mitigation

Add validation to ensure claims are only for completed periods:

```solidity
function claim() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    (uint256 currentPeriod,) = bondToken.globalPool();
    // Only allow claims for previous period
    uint256 claimPeriod = currentPeriod - 1;
    uint256 shares = bondToken.getIndexedUserAmount(msg.sender, balance, claimPeriod);
    // ...
}
```
