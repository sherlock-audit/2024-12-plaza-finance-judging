# Wrong estimation of the usd value in the redeem function

### Summary

The function redeem assume that the value of the bond token redeemed is eqal to 100 usd which is not always true making the transaction revert because of an underflow or even making the user having a higher reserve token amount back than he previously deposited.

### Root Cause

In the Pool contract, when a user wants to create tokens, if the token is the bond token and the collateral level is ≤ 1.2, the protocol computes the creation rate as follows:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L333
If the token is the bond token :
The multiplier is eqal to 80% (800000 with 1000000 precision).
tvl is the usd value of the reserve of the pool

If the collateral level > 1.2 then the formula will be : 

amountReceived = usdValueOfDeposit/100 (therefore the value of 1 bondToken = 100 $)

So, the pool will give the user more tokens if the collateral level is ≤ 1.2, as we can see in the same function :
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L343

 if the user redeems their bond token, the collateral level will be computed as follows:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L498
The problem is that if the tokens were created when the collateral level was ≤ 1.2, the user received more bond tokens for the same reserve amount, causing the protocol to overestimate the value of those tokens and ultimately causing the call to revert.



### Internal Pre-conditions

The creation should have been made when the protocol is undercollateralized.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The user will not be able to redeem his tokens.

### PoC

You can run the POC by copy past this code in the Pool.t.sol file in the test folder and run forge test --mt test_redeemRevertPOC -vv

```solidity
function test_redeemRevertPOC() public {
     vm.startPrank(governance);
        Token rToken = Token(params.reserveToken);

        // Mint reserve tokens
        rToken.mint(governance, 10000001000);
        rToken.approve(address(poolFactory), 10000000000);

        // Create pool and approve deposit amount
        // We create an undercollateralized pool intentionally for the test.
        Pool _pool = Pool(poolFactory.createPool(params, 10, 10000, 10000, "", "", "", "", false));
        rToken.approve(address(_pool), 1000);

        // Call create
        vm.expectRevert();
        uint256 amount = _pool.redeem(Pool.TokenType.BOND, 1000, 0);
        uint256 valueOfBondTokens = uint(1000*100);
        uint256 valueInPool = uint(10*3000e8/1e8);  
         console2.log("usd value estimated of the redeem amount : %d", valueOfBondTokens);
         console2.log("usd value in the pool : %d", valueInPool);
         console2.log("Delta between the two values : %d", int(int(valueInPool)-int(valueOfBondTokens)));
        
        // Reset reserve state
        rToken.burn(governance, rToken.balanceOf(governance));
        rToken.burn(address(_pool), rToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)));    
        }
```
You should have this output : 

```solidity
[PASS] test_redeemRevertPOC() (gas: 1837853)
Logs:
  usd value estimated of the redeem amount : 100000
  usd value in the pool : 30000
  Delta between the two values : -70000
```
### Mitigation

As a mitigation, the pool should keep track of the corresponding reserveAmount during token creation in order to compute the collateral level correctly.
