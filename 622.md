# Incorrect calculation of the amount for the claim depending on the activity in the periods

### Summary

User can claim the coupons for previous periods even when he doesn't participate in them through incorrect logic in the `getIndexedUserAmount()` functionality.

### Root Cause

The [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BondToken.sol#L1907) on the possible issue in the `BondToken` smart contract.

According to the business logic described in the project docs, the user should be able to claim tokens only for those distribution periods in which he participated and was a Bondholder. 

The reply from the Plaza [docs](https://docs.plaza.finance/protocol-mechanics/coupon-distributions#checkpointing): 

> It determines which period the asset has been transferred in and tallies up all of the unclaimed coupons for each period. Therefore, there is always a running record of each holder and the distribution period that they have held at. Thus, when a distribution occurs and the period increases, there is still evidence that the user was holding a bond in previous periods and the user will be eligible to claim previous coupons from the Distributor. 


However right now the protocol is written with conditions in the `getIndexedUserAmount()` function that uses the same balance value for all periods, assuming user was a Bondholder in the past.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user's balance shouldn't be updated in the previous periods, i.e. the user doesn't participate in these periods, doesn't claim and tranfer tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Attack:
1. Olivia doesn't participate in first 3 periods. As a result, `lastUpdatedPeriod` value equals to 0 and `balanceOf(bondToken)` equals to 0.
2. Then Olivia makes a deposit and receives 1 Bond Tokens as a result.
3. Olivia claims 10 tokens (`Distributor SC`, 4 periods == 10 tokens according to the docs, 1 period == 2.5 tokens during distribution). 

So Olivia has 0 tokens during the first 3 periods, however claims 7.5 USDC. This is incorrect.

The example from the [docs](https://docs.plaza.finance/protocol-mechanics/coupon-distributions#checkpointing). Two users have a same amount, however they have participated in different fractions.

### Impact

Bondholder can claim tokens even for those periods in which he did not participate. For example, if a user became a Bondholder only in the last 4 period, he can claim tokens for all 4 periods: from 1 to 4. 

Basically, a Bondholder who does not participate in all periods can, under certain conditions, receive the same amount of tokens as a Bondholder who is active in all periods.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The coupons for the claim by the user must be calculated based when user was connected to the pool (on the duration of the user joining the pool).
