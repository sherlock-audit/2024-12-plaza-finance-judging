# [M-03] Lack of upper bound check in _create() and _redeem() potentially leads to Over-Minting and Over-Redemption

### Summary

In Pool, the _create() and _redeem() functions currently only checks if the amount is bigger than the minAmount, checks that amount is not 0, however, it does not check for edge case where the amount could be bigger than the poolReserves.

This missing check could potentially allow malicious users to mint more tokens than available reserves, redeem more reserve tokens than available liquidity.

### Root Cause

- `_create()` relies on `simulateCreate()` to determine amount, but it does not check that the `amount <= poolReserves` before minting
- `_redeem()` relies on `simulateRedeem()` to calculate `reserveAmount`, but it does not enforce `reserveAmount <= poolReserves` before transferring reserves.

If `simulateCreate()` or `simulateRedeem()` overestimates the values, the system may attempt to mint or transfer more tokens than it actually holds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- _create() and _redeem() assume simulateCreate() and simulateRedeem() always return valid values within available liquidity.
- The contract does not verify the real-time reserve balance before executing minting or redemption.


### External Pre-conditions

- Users can initiate _create() with large depositAmount values, potentially triggering an overestimation of mintable tokens.
- Users can initiate _redeem() with large depositAmount values, triggering an overestimation of redeemable reserve tokens.
- If an oracle or market rate fluctuation occurs between simulation and execution, poolReserves may be miscalculated.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Risk of liquidity drain, where LPs cannot withdraw their full balance and risk of insolvency, as more tokens exist than the protocol can cover.
