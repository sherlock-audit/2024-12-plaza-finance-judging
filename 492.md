# Malicious User Can Grief an Auction by Manipulating Pool Reserves

### Summary

A lack of validation on the reserve token balance in the `endAuction` function allows a malicious user to withdraw reserve tokens from the pool just before the auction ends. This manipulation results in a failure state (`FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`), even if the auction was otherwise valid. The attacker exploits the mutable balance calculation to force the auction to fail by reducing the reserve token balance below the required threshold.

### Root Cause



The issue lies in how the `endAuction` function calculates the pool's reserve token balance dynamically at the time of evaluation. 


```solidity
else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
    state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
}
```

The function uses the current balance of the `sellReserveToken` in the pool to determine whether the `totalSellReserveAmount` exceeds the permissible threshold defined by `poolSaleLimit`. However, this balance is mutable and can be manipulated by withdrawing tokens from the pool after the auction begins. This dynamic calculation allows malicious actors to interfere with the auction’s outcome.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `endAuction` function relies on `IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool)` to calculate the failure condition.
2. The Malicious user holds a portion of the reserve tokens in the pool (e.g., `>10%` of the pool's total reserve tokens).


### External Pre-conditions

1. The reserve token balance in the pool decreases enough to make `totalSellReserveAmount` exceed `(IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100`.


### Attack Path


1. Assume the pool initially holds `50 wstETH`.

2. The `poolSaleLimit` is set to `90%`, allowing the auction to sell up to `45 wstETH` (90% of 50).

3. The auction begins, and bids are placed as normal.

4. A malicious user, `owning 11%` (or more) of the pool's reserve tokens, withdraws their share just before the auction ends.

5. This reduces the pool’s reserve token balance to `44.25 wstETH`.

6. At the time of `endAuction`, the condition:
   ```solidity
   totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100
   ```
   becomes true because:
   - `totalSellReserveAmount = 40 wstETH`
   - `(44.25 * 90) / 100 = 39.825 wstETH`
   - `40 >= 39.825` evaluates to true.
7. The auction enters the `FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT` state, resulting in a failed auction despite valid bids and participation.


### Impact

A malicious user can grief the protocol auction process, disrupting its fairness, causing failed auctions, and undermining user trust in receiving 2.5 USDC every three months for each `bondETH` they hold.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


To prevent this issue, the protocol should **lock the reserve token balance** in the pool at the start of the auction. This ensures that the auction's outcome cannot be manipulated by changes in the reserve token balance.
