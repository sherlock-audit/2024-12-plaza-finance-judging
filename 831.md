# joining balancer pool may user less than `maxAmountsIn` but `BalancerRouter.sol` is not returning the remaining assets back to the user

### Summary

When joining balancer Pool to get poolToken it takes `maxAmountsIn` as an input, which indicates the maximum amount users willing to stake in the pool. Balancer may use less than the `maxAmountsIn` set by the users. But `BalancerRouter` is not returning back the excess amount back to the user.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/14a962c52a8f4731bbe4655a2f6d0d85e144c7c2/plaza-evm/src/BalancerRouter.sol#L86

`BalancerRouter.sol::joinBalancerPool()`:-

```javascript
        function joinBalancerPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        IAsset[] memory assets,
        uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn,
        bytes memory userData
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
@>          IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), maxAmountsIn[i]);
            IERC20(address(assets[i])).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(balancerVault), maxAmountsIn[i]);
        }

        IVault.JoinPoolRequest memory request = IVault.JoinPoolRequest({
            assets: assets,
@>          maxAmountsIn: maxAmountsIn,
            userData: userData,
            fromInternalBalance: false
        });
@>      balancerVault.joinPool(poolId, address(this), address(this), request);
    }
```

`BalancerRouter` pulls `maxAmountsIn` assets from user and uses the assets to join the pool. Pool may pull less amount than `maxAmountsIn` but `BalancerRouter` is not returning back the remaining amount to the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

Balancer pool uses less than `maxAmountsIn` when joining the pool.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User will face loss as they are not getting back the remaining assets and these assets will be locked forever in the `BalancerRouter.sol`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

return the excess amount back to the user.
