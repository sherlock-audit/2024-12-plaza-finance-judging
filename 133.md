# In `Pool.sol::getRedeemAmount()` there is nothing for `marketRate` of levETH.

### Summary
The `marketRate` value being passed in `getRedeemAmount()` is only of BONDeth, there is nothing for marketRate of `levETH`.

**function flow**

1. User wants to redeem levETH, so he chooses the token tyoe as levETH.
2. so the function execution will be -user -> redeem -> _redeem -> simulateRedeem -> getRedeemAmount.
3. if the `redeemRate` is higher than the param `marketRate` and `marketRate` is non-zero then below condition will execute -
```js
    if (marketRate != 0 && marketRate < redeemRate) {
      redeemRate = marketRate;
    }
```
4. now as the `marketRate` is of bondETH, not levETH. the new redeemRate of levETH will be set for marketRate of BONDeth. which will be unexpected.

### Root Cause
No marketRate of levETH is passed in the param.
### Impact
User will get incorrect Redeem amount value, either causing fund loss to user itself or protocol.
### Mitigation
Passing the marketRate of levETH in the `getRedeemAmount` function.
