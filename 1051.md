# USDC blacklist will permanently DOS the Auction contract affecting all users

### Summary

USDC's blacklist functionality will cause a permanent DOS of the Auction contract for all users, as any blacklisted address with an active bid will prevent `_removeBid()` from executing successfully since USDC transfers to blacklisted addresses will revert.

### Root Cause
The protocol expects to use USDC as the couponToken in the auctions. Note that USDC has a blacklist. As users bid in the auction, it reaches a point where excess bids need to removed which is done by calling the internal function [removeExcessBids()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L250) from the bid function. This removeExcessBids function calls [_removeBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L298) with the bidIndex of the bidder to be removed. 

Now the issue is that In [Auction.sol:L325](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L325) the decision to directly transfer USDC tokens back to bidders without handling potential blacklist failures is a mistake as USDC transfers to blacklisted addresses will revert, causing a permanent DOS of the contract.
```solidity
function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
// ...
IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(bidder, sellCouponAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An auction must be active with USDC as the coupon token
2. A bidder must have placed a valid bid in the auction
3. The bidder's address must become blacklisted by USDC after placing their bid

### External Pre-conditions

1. USDC's compliance team blacklists the bidder's address


### Attack Path

1. Alice places a valid bid in the auction using USDC as coupon token
2. Alice's address gets blacklisted by USDC's compliance team
3. When another user tries to place a bid that would trigger `removeExcessBids()`
4. The `_removeBid()` function attempts to refund USDC to Alice 
5. The USDC transfer reverts due to Alice being blacklisted
6. The entire auction becomes permanently stuck as no new bids can be placed


### Impact

The entire auction system becomes permanently unusable for all users. No new bids can be placed and the auction cannot proceed, effectively freezing user funds in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a pull payment pattern instead of push payments:
Example:
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public pendingRefunds;

function _removeBid(uint256 bidIndex) internal {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Instead of transfer
    pendingRefunds[bidder] += sellCouponAmount;
}

function withdrawRefund() external {
    uint256 amount = pendingRefunds[msg.sender];
    pendingRefunds[msg.sender] = 0;
    IERC20(buyCouponToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
