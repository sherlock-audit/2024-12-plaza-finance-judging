# Reduced pool reserves due to frequent redeem() during auctions can lead to excessive reserve depletion or repeated auction failures, impacting bond token holders.

### Summary

The dynamic nature of `IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool)` allows pool reserves to significantly decrease via `redeem()` with minimal created() activity. Consequently, the auction may fail due to `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`, denying bond token holders their coupon distributions. Without recalibration, this issue could persist across multiple quarters.

Additionally, the `DistributionRollOver` event in Pool.sol adds confusion, as no actual coupon rollover occurs. Future coupon amounts are determined independently by `bondToken.totalSupply()` and `sharesPerToken`.

### Root Cause

The choice to associate the `poolSaleLimit` dynamically with the reserve balance at the end of the auction fails to account for:

- Fluctuations in pool reserves during the auction period leaning towards `redeem()`.
- The absence of mechanisms to adjust `totalBuyCouponAmount` (`couponAmountToDistribute`) based on reduced reserves or remove low-priority bids.
- Misleading event names, such as `DistributionRollOver`, which inaccurately imply that unfulfilled coupons carry over to subsequent quarters.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Auction Creation:

- `startAuction()` initializes the auction with `couponAmountToDistribute` based on the current `bondToken.totalSupply()` and `sharesPerToken`.

2. Auction Bidding:

- Participants place bids, and `currentCouponAmount` grows to meet `totalBuyCouponAmount`.
3. Auction Failure:

- Failure: Reserves decrease significantly, causing the auction to fail due to `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`.

### External Pre-conditions

Low market demand or redemptions significantly reduce pool reserves during the auction period.

### Attack Path

1. The auction is started with `totalBuyCouponAmount` determined by `bondToken.totalSupply()` and `sharesPerToken`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L545-L550

```solidity
    uint256 normalizedTotalSupply = bondToken.totalSupply().normalizeAmount(bondDecimals, maxDecimals);
    uint256 normalizedShares = sharesPerToken.normalizeAmount(sharesDecimals, maxDecimals);

    // Calculate the coupon amount to distribute
    uint256 couponAmountToDistribute = (normalizedTotalSupply * normalizedShares)
        .toBaseUnit(maxDecimals * 2 - IERC20(couponToken).safeDecimals());
```
2. Pool reserves fluctuate during the auction period due to heavy `redeem()` operations.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Pool.sol#L410

```solidity
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(recipient, reserveAmount);
```
3. At auction end:
- If reserves decrease, the auction could fail with `State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT`, denying bond token holders their coupon distributions.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance/blob/main/plaza-evm/src/Auction.sol#L341-L342

```solidity
    } else if (totalSellReserveAmount >= (IERC20(sellReserveToken).balanceOf(pool) * poolSaleLimit) / 100) {
        state = State.FAILED_POOL_SALE_LIMIT;
```

### Impact

Bond token holders are denied coupon distributions due to auction failure and must wait for the next quarter and perhaps repeatedly in subsequent quarters if similar situation occurs, leading to user dissatisfaction and loss of trust in the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Reduce `sharesPerToken` and recalculate proportionally `totalBuyCouponAmount` to avoid failing the auction unnecessarily.
2. Trim or remove low-priority bids dynamically. This preserves bids with higher implied prices and improves auction efficiency.
