# transferReserveToAuction() will always revert due to getting wrong auction address

### Summary

transferReserveToAuction() always assume that auction always is from the current period while in fact it is not. The auction is always from the previous period instead.

### Root Cause

After a new auction is started via startAunction(), current period is increased by 1.

That means the current on going auction is in `currentPeriod -1` (previous period)
However,  transferReserveToAuction() always check if the caller is the auction of `currentPeriod` which will always be 0. This will cause revert and the current auction cannot end.

### Mitigation

Consider getting the correct period:
```solidity
 function transferReserveToAuction(uint256 amount) external virtual {
    (uint256 currentPeriod, ) = bondToken.globalPool();
    >>> address auctionAddress = auctions[currentPeriod - 1];
    require(msg.sender == auctionAddress, CallerIsNotAuction());
    
    IERC20(reserveToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```
